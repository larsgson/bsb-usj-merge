\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Job’s Character and Wealth
\r <br /><span class=|cross|>(<a href =|../james/5.htm#7|>James 5:7–12</a>)</span>
\p
\v 1 There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job. And this man was blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil.
\v 2 He had seven sons and three daughters,
\v 3 and he owned 7,000  sheep, 3,000  camels, 500 yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and a very large number of servants. Job was the greatest man of all the people of the East.
\p
\v 4 Job’s sons would take turns holding feasts in their homes,  and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
\p
\v 5 And when the days of feasting were over, Job would send for his children to purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for all of them. For Job thought, Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. This was Job’s regular practice.
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Satan’s First Attack
\p
\v 6 One day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan \f + \fr 1:6 \fr* \ft That is, <i>the Accuser</i> or <i>the Adversary</i>; here and throughout Job 1\ft* \f* also came with them.
\p
\v 7 Where have you come from?” said the LORD to Satan.
\p From roaming through the earth,” he  replied, and walking back and forth in it.”
\p
\v 8 Then the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered  My servant Job? For there is no one on earth like him, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil.”
\p
\v 9 Satan answered the LORD, Does Job fear God for nothing?
\v 10 Have You not placed a hedge on every side around him and his household and all that he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
\v 11 But stretch out Your hand and strike all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.”
\p
\v 12 Very well, said the LORD to Satan. Everything he has is in your hands, but you must not lay a hand on the man himself.
\p Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Job Loses His Children and Possessions
\p
\v 13 One day, while Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
\v 14 a messenger came and reported to Job: While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby ,
\v 15 the Sabeans swooped down and took them away. They put the servants to the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
\p
\v 16 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: The fire of God fell from heaven. It burned and consumed the sheep and the servants, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
\p
\v 17 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: The Chaldeans formed three bands, raided the camels, and took them away. They put the servants to the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
\p
\v 18 While he was still speaking, another messenger came and reported: Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house,
\v 19 when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
\p
\v 20 Then Job stood up, tore his robe, and shaved his head. He fell to the ground and worshiped,
\v 21 saying:
\p Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
\p and naked I will return .
\p The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away.
\p Blessed be the name of the LORD.
\p
\v 22 In all this, Job did not sin or charge God with wrongdoing.
\c 2
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Job Loses His Health
\p
\v 1 On another day the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan \f + \fr 2:1 \fr* \ft That is, <i>the Accuser</i> or <i>the Adversary</i>; here and throughout Job 2\ft* \f* also came with them to present himself before Him.
\p
\v 2 Where have you come from?” said the LORD to Satan.
\p From roaming through the earth, he replied , and walking back and forth in it.”
\p
\v 3 Then the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered  My servant Job? For there is no one on earth like him, a man who is blameless and upright, who fears God and shuns evil. He still retains his integrity, even though you incited Me against him to ruin him without cause.”
\p
\v 4 Skin for skin! Satan replied . A man will give up all he owns in exchange for his life.
\v 5 But stretch out Your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse You to Your face.”
\p
\v 6 Very well, said the LORD to Satan. He is in your hands, but you must spare his life.”
\p
\v 7 So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and infected Job with terrible boils from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.
\v 8 And Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself as he sat among the ashes.
\p
\v 9 Then Job’s wife said to him, Do you still retain your integrity? Curse \f + \fr 2:9 \fr* \ft Or <i>Bless</i>\ft* \f* God and die!”
\p
\v 10 You speak as a foolish woman speaks,  he told her. Should we accept from God only good and not adversity?
\p In all this, Job did not sin in what he said.
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Job’s Three Friends
\p
\v 11 Now when Job’s three friends— Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite— heard about all this adversity that had come upon him, each of them came from his home, and they met together to go and sympathize with Job and comfort him.
\p
\v 12 When they lifted up their eyes from afar, they could barely recognize Job. They began to weep aloud , and each man tore his robe and threw dust in the air over his head.
\v 13 Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights, but no one spoke a word to him because they saw how intense his suffering was.
\c 3
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Job Laments His Birth
\p
\v 1 After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.
\v 2 And this is what he said:
\p
\v 3 May the day of my birth perish,
\p and the night it was said,
\p A boy is conceived.
\p
\v 4 If only that day had turned to darkness!
\p May God above  disregard it;
\p may no light shine upon it.
\p
\v 5 May darkness and gloom reclaim it,
\p and a cloud settle over it;
\p may the blackness of the day overwhelm it.
\p
\v 6 If only darkness had taken that night away!
\p May it not appear among the days of the year;
\p may it never be entered in any of the months.
\p
\v 7 Behold, may that night be barren;
\p may no joyful voice come into it.
\p
\v 8 May it be cursed by those who curse the day \f + \fr 3:8 \fr* \ft Or <i>curse the sea</i>\ft* \f*
\p those prepared to rouse Leviathan.
\p
\v 9 May its morning stars grow dark;
\p may it wait in vain for daylight;
\p may it not see the breaking of dawn.
\p
\v 10 For that night did not shut the doors of the womb
\p to hide the sorrow from my eyes.
\p
\v 11 Why did I not perish at birth;
\p why did I not die as I came from the womb?
\p
\v 12 Why were there knees to receive me,
\p and breasts that I should be nursed?
\p
\v 13 For now I would be lying down in peace;
\p I would be asleep and at rest
\p
\v 14 with kings and counselors of the earth,
\p who built for themselves cities now in ruins,
\p
\v 15 or with princes who had gold ,
\p who filled their houses with silver.
\p
\v 16 Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child,
\p like an infant who never sees daylight?
\p
\v 17 There the wicked cease from raging,
\p and there the weary find rest.
\p
\v 18 The captives enjoy their ease;
\p they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
\p
\v 19 Both small and great are there ,
\p and the slave is freed from his master.
\p
\v 20 Why is light given to the miserable,
\p and life to the bitter of soul,
\p
\v 21 who long for death that does not come,
\p and search for it like hidden treasure,
\p
\v 22 who rejoice and greatly exult
\p when they reach the grave?
\p
\v 23 Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden,
\p whom God has hedged in?
\p
\v 24 I sigh when food is put before me,
\p and my groans pour out like water.
\p
\v 25 For the thing I feared has overtaken me,
\p and what I dreaded has befallen me.
\p
\v 26 I am not at ease or quiet ;
\p I have no rest, for trouble has come.
\c 4
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Eliphaz: The Innocent Prosper
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
\p
\v 2 If one ventures a word with you, will you be wearied?
\p Yet who can keep from speaking?
\p
\v 3 Surely you have instructed many,
\p and have strengthened their feeble hands.
\p
\v 4 Your words have steadied those who stumbled;
\p you have braced the knees that were buckling.
\p
\v 5 But now trouble has come upon you, and you are weary.
\p It strikes you, and you are dismayed.
\p
\v 6 Is your reverence not your confidence,
\p and the uprightness of your ways your hope?
\p
\v 7 Consider now, I plead:
\p Who, being innocent, has ever perished?
\p Or where have the upright been destroyed?
\p
\v 8 As I have observed, those who plow iniquity
\p and those who sow trouble reap the same.
\p
\v 9 By the breath of God they perish,
\p and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.
\p
\v 10 The lion may roar, and the fierce lion may growl,
\p yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.
\p
\v 11 The old lion perishes for lack of prey,
\p and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
\p
\v 12 Now a word came to me secretly;
\p my ears caught a whisper of it.
\p
\v 13 In disquieting visions in the night,
\p when deep sleep falls on men,
\p
\v 14 fear and trembling came over me
\p and made all my bones shudder.
\p
\v 15 Then a spirit \f + \fr 4:15 \fr* \ft Or <i>a wind</i>\ft* \f* glided past my face,
\p and the hair on my body bristled.
\p
\v 16 It stood still,
\p but I could not discern its appearance;
\p a form loomed before my eyes,
\p and I heard a whispering voice:
\p
\v 17 Can a mortal be more righteous than God,
\p or a man more pure than his Maker?
\p
\v 18 If God puts no trust in His servants,
\p and He charges His angels with error,
\p
\v 19 how much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
\p whose foundations are in the dust,
\p who can be crushed like a moth!
\p
\v 20 They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk;
\p unnoticed , they perish forever.
\p
\v 21 Are not their tent cords pulled up,
\p so that they die without wisdom?
\c 5
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Eliphaz Continues: God Blesses those Who Seek Him
\p
\v 1 Call out if you please, but who will answer?
\p To which of the holy ones will you turn?
\p
\v 2 For resentment kills a fool,
\p and envy slays the simple.
\p
\v 3 I have seen a fool taking root,
\p but suddenly his house was cursed.
\p
\v 4 His sons are far from safety,
\p crushed in court without a defender.
\p
\v 5 The hungry consume his harvest,
\p taking it even from the thorns,
\p and the thirsty pant after his wealth. \f + \fr 5:5 \fr* \ft Or <i>and a snare snatches his wealth</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 6 For distress does not spring from the dust,
\p and trouble does not sprout from the ground.
\p
\v 7 Yet man is born to trouble
\p as surely as sparks fly upward.
\p
\v 8 However, if I were you, I would appeal to God
\p and lay my cause before Him—
\p
\v 9 the One who does great and unsearchable things,
\p wonders without number.
\p
\v 10 He gives rain to the earth
\p and sends water upon the fields.
\p
\v 11 He sets the lowly on high,
\p so that mourners are lifted to safety.
\p
\v 12 He thwarts the schemes of the crafty,
\p so that their hands find no success.
\p
\v 13 He catches the wise in their craftiness, \f + \fr 5:13 \fr* \ft Cited in 1 Corinthians 3:19\ft* \f*
\p and sweeps away the plans of the cunning.
\p
\v 14 They encounter darkness by day
\p and grope at noon as in the night.
\p
\v 15 He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth
\p and from the clutches of the powerful.
\p
\v 16 So the poor have hope,
\p and injustice shuts its mouth.
\p
\v 17 Blessed indeed is the man whom God corrects;
\p so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty. \f + \fr 5:17 \fr* \ft Hebrew <i>Shaddai</i>; here and throughout Job\ft* \f*
\p
\v 18 For He wounds, but He also binds;
\p He strikes, but His hands also heal.
\p
\v 19 He will rescue you from six calamities;
\p no harm will touch you in seven.
\p
\v 20 In famine He will redeem you from death,
\p and in battle from the stroke of the sword.
\p
\v 21 You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
\p and will not fear havoc when it comes.
\p
\v 22 You will laugh at destruction and famine,
\p and need not fear the beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 23 For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field,
\p and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
\p
\v 24 You will know that your tent is secure,
\p and find nothing amiss when inspecting your home.
\p
\v 25 You will know that your offspring will be many,
\p your descendants like the grass of the earth.
\p
\v 26 You will come to the grave in full vigor,
\p like a sheaf of grain gathered in season.
\p
\v 27 Indeed, we have investigated , and it is true!
\p So hear it and know for yourself.
\c 6
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Job Replies: My Complaint Is Just
\p
\v 1 Then Job replied:
\p
\v 2 If only my grief could be weighed
\p and placed with my calamity on the scales.
\p
\v 3 For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas —
\p no wonder my words have been rash.
\p
\v 4 For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me;
\p my spirit drinks in their poison;
\p the terrors of God are arrayed against me.
\p
\v 5 Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass,
\p or an ox low over its fodder?
\p
\v 6 Is tasteless food eaten without salt,
\p or is there flavor in the white of an egg \f + \fr 6:6 \fr* \ft Or <i>in the sap of the mallow plant</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 7 My soul refuses to touch them;
\p they are loathsome food to me.
\p
\v 8 If only my request were granted
\p and God would fulfill my hope:
\p
\v 9 that God would be willing to crush me,
\p to unleash His hand and cut me off!
\p
\v 10 It still brings me comfort,
\p and joy through unrelenting pain,
\p that I have not denied
\p the words of the Holy One.
\p
\v 11 What strength do I have, that I should still hope?
\p What is my future, that I should be patient?
\p
\v 12 Is my strength like that of stone,
\p or my flesh made of bronze ?
\p
\v 13 Is there any help within me
\p now that success is driven from me?
\p
\v 14 A despairing man should have the kindness of his friend,
\p even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.
\p
\v 15 But my brothers are as faithless as wadis,
\p as seasonal streams that overflow,
\p
\v 16 darkened because of the ice
\p and the inflow of melting snow,
\p
\v 17 but ceasing in the dry season
\p and vanishing from their channels in the heat.
\p
\v 18 Caravans turn aside from their routes;
\p they go into the wasteland and perish.
\p
\v 19 The caravans of Tema look for water;
\p the travelers of Sheba hope to find it.
\p
\v 20 They are confounded because they had hoped;
\p their arrival brings disappointment.
\p
\v 21 For now you are of no help;
\p you see terror, and you are afraid.
\p
\v 22 Have I ever said, Give me something
\p offer me a bribe from your wealth;
\p
\v 23 deliver me from the hand of the enemy;
\p redeem me from the grasp of the ruthless’
\p
\v 24 Teach me, and I will be silent.
\p Help me understand how I have erred.
\p
\v 25 How painful are honest words!
\p But what does your argument prove?
\p
\v 26 Do you intend to correct my words,
\p and treat as wind my cry of despair?
\p
\v 27 You would even cast lots for an orphan
\p and barter away  your friend.
\p
\v 28 But now, please look at me.
\p Would I lie to your face ?
\p
\v 29 Reconsider; do not be unjust.
\p Reconsider, for my righteousness is at stake.
\p
\v 30 Is there iniquity on my tongue?
\p Can my mouth not discern malice?
\c 7
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Job Continues: Life Seems Futile
\p
\v 1 Is not man consigned to labor on earth?
\p Are not his days like those of a hired hand?
\p
\v 2 Like a slave he longs for shade;
\p like a hireling he waits for his wages.
\p
\v 3 So I am allotted months of futility,
\p and nights of misery are appointed to me.
\p
\v 4 When I lie down I think:
\p When will I get up?
\p But the night drags on,
\p and I toss and turn until dawn.
\p
\v 5 My flesh is clothed with worms
\p and encrusted with dirt;
\p my skin is cracked and festering.
\p
\v 6 My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle;
\p they come to an end without hope.
\p
\v 7 Remember that my life is but a breath.
\p My eyes will never again see happiness.
\p
\v 8 The eye that beholds me will no longer see me.
\p You will look for me, but I will be no more.
\p
\v 9 As a cloud vanishes and is gone,
\p so he who goes down to Sheol does not come back up.
\p
\v 10 He never returns to his house;
\p his place remembers him no more.
\p
\v 11 Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;
\p I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
\p I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
\p
\v 12 Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep,
\p that You must keep me under guard?
\p
\v 13 When I think my bed will comfort me
\p and my couch will ease my complaint,
\p
\v 14 then You frighten me with dreams
\p and terrify me with visions,
\p
\v 15 so that I would prefer strangling and death
\p over my life in this body.
\p
\v 16 I loathe my life! I would not live forever.
\p Leave me alone , for my days are but a breath.
\p
\v 17 What is man that You should exalt him,
\p that You should set Your heart upon him,
\p
\v 18 that You attend to him every morning,
\p and test him every moment?
\p
\v 19 Will You never look away from me,
\p or leave me alone to swallow my spittle?
\p
\v 20 If I have sinned, what have I done to You,
\p O watcher of mankind?
\p Why have You made me Your target,
\p so that I am a burden to You \f + \fr 7:20 \fr* \ft LXX; Hebrew <i>to myself</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 21 Why do You not pardon my transgression
\p and take away my iniquity?
\p For soon I will lie down in the dust;
\p You will seek me, but I will be no more.
\c 8
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Bildad: Job Should Repent
\p
\v 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
\p
\v 2 How long will you go on saying such things?
\p The words of your mouth are a blustering wind.
\p
\v 3 Does God pervert justice?
\p Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
\p
\v 4 When your children sinned against Him,
\p He gave them over to their rebellion.
\p
\v 5 But if you would earnestly seek God
\p and ask the Almighty for mercy,
\p
\v 6 if you are pure and upright,
\p even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf
\p and restore your righteous estate.
\p
\v 7 Though your beginnings were modest,
\p your latter days will flourish .
\p
\v 8 Please inquire of past generations
\p and consider the discoveries of their fathers.
\p
\v 9 For we were born yesterday and know nothing;
\p our days on earth are but a shadow.
\p
\v 10 Will they not teach you and tell you,
\p and speak from their understanding?
\p
\v 11 Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh?
\p Do reeds flourish without water?
\p
\v 12 While the shoots are still uncut ,
\p they dry up more quickly than grass.
\p
\v 13 Such is the destiny of all who forget God;
\p so the hope of the godless will perish.
\p
\v 14 His confidence is fragile;
\p his security is in a spider’s web.
\p
\v 15 He leans on his web, but it gives way;
\p he holds fast but it does not endure.
\p
\v 16 He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine,
\p spreading its shoots over the garden.
\p
\v 17 His roots wrap around the rock heap;
\p he looks for a home among the stones.
\p
\v 18 If he is uprooted from his place,
\p it will disown him, saying, ‘ I never saw you.
\p
\v 19 Surely this is the joy of his way;
\p yet others will spring from the dust.
\p
\v 20 Behold, God does not reject the blameless,
\p nor will He strengthen the hand of evildoers.
\p
\v 21 He will yet fill your mouth with laughter,
\p and your lips with a shout of joy.
\p
\v 22 Your enemies will be clothed in shame,
\p and the tent of the wicked will be no more.

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Job: How Can I Contend with God?
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered:
\p
\v 2 Yes, I know that it is so,
\p but how can a mortal be righteous before God?
\p
\v 3 If one wished to contend with God, \f + \fr 9:3 \fr* \ft Or <i>If God wished to contend with someone</i>\ft* \f*
\p he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.
\p
\v 4 God is wise in heart and mighty in strength.
\p Who has resisted Him and prospered?
\p
\v 5 He moves mountains without their knowledge
\p and overturns them in His anger.
\p
\v 6 He shakes the earth from its place,
\p so that its foundations tremble.
\p
\v 7 He commands the sun not to shine; \f + \fr 9:7 \fr* \ft Or <i>rise</i>\ft* \f*
\p He seals off the stars.
\p
\v 8 He alone stretches out the heavens
\p and treads on the waves of the sea.
\p
\v 9 He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion,
\p of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.
\p
\v 10 He does great things beyond searching out,
\p and wonders without number.
\p
\v 11 Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him;
\p were He to move, I would not recognize Him.
\p
\v 12 If He takes away, \f + \fr 9:12 \fr* \ft Or <i>snatches someone in death</i>\ft* \f* who can stop Him?
\p Who dares to ask Him, What are You doing?
\p
\v 13 God does not restrain His anger;
\p the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him.
\p
\v 14 How then can I answer Him
\p or choose my arguments against Him?
\p
\v 15 For even if I were right, I could not answer.
\p I could only beg my Judge for mercy.
\p
\v 16 If I summoned Him and He answered me,
\p I do not believe He would listen to my voice.
\p
\v 17 For He would crush me with a tempest
\p and multiply my wounds without cause.
\p
\v 18 He does not let me catch my breath,
\p but overwhelms me with bitterness.
\p
\v 19 If it is a matter of strength,
\p He is indeed mighty!
\p If it is a matter of justice,
\p who can summon Him \f + \fr 9:19 \fr* \ft See LXX; Hebrew <i>me</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 20 Even if I were righteous, my mouth would condemn me;
\p if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty. \f + \fr 9:20 \fr* \ft Or <i>He would declare me guilty</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 21 Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself;
\p I despise my own life.
\p
\v 22 It is all the same, and so I say,
\p He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.
\p
\v 23 When the scourge brings sudden death,
\p He mocks the despair of the innocent.
\p
\v 24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
\p He blindfolds its judges.
\p If it is not He, then who is it?
\p
\v 25 My days are swifter than a runner;
\p they flee without seeing good.
\p
\v 26 They sweep by like boats of papyrus,
\p like an eagle swooping down on its prey.
\p
\v 27 If I were to say, I will forget my complaint
\p and change my expression and smile,
\p
\v 28 I would still dread all my sufferings;
\p I know that You will not acquit me.
\p
\v 29 Since I am already found guilty,
\p why should I labor in vain?
\p
\v 30 If I should wash myself with snow \f + \fr 9:30 \fr* \ft Or <i>soap</i>\ft* \f*
\p and cleanse my hands with lye,
\p
\v 31 then You would plunge me into the pit,
\p and even my own clothes would despise me.
\p

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Job’s Plea to God
\p
\v 1 I loathe my own life;
\p I will express my complaint
\p and speak in the bitterness of my soul.
\p
\v 2 I will say to God:
\p Do not condemn me!
\p Let me know why You prosecute me.
\p
\v 3 Does it please You to oppress me,
\p to reject the work of Your hands
\p and favor the schemes of the wicked?
\p
\v 4 Do You have eyes of flesh
\p Do You see as man sees?
\p
\v 5 Are Your days like those of a mortal,
\p or Your years like those of a man,
\p
\v 6 that You should seek my iniquity
\p and search out my sin —
\p
\v 7 though You know that I am not guilty,
\p and there is no deliverance from Your hand?
\p
\v 8 Your hands shaped me and altogether formed me.
\p Would You now turn and destroy me?
\p
\v 9 Please remember that You molded me like clay.
\p Would You now return me to dust?
\p
\v 10 Did You not pour me out like milk,
\p and curdle me like cheese?
\p
\v 11 You clothed me with skin and flesh,
\p and knit me together with bones and sinews.
\p
\v 12 You have granted me life and loving devotion, \f + \fr 10:12 \fr* \ft Forms of the Hebrew <i>chesed</i> are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as <i>loving devotion</i>; the range of meaning includes <i>love</i>, <i>goodness</i>, <i>kindness</i>, <i>faithfulness</i>, and <i>mercy</i>, as well as <i>loyalty to a covenant</i>.\ft* \f*
\p and Your care has preserved my spirit.
\p
\v 13 Yet You concealed these things in Your heart,
\p and I know that this was in Your mind:
\p
\v 14 If I sinned, You would take note,
\p and would not acquit me of my iniquity.
\p
\v 15 If I am guilty, woe to me!
\p And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift my head.
\p I am full of shame
\p and aware of my affliction.
\p
\v 16 Should I hold my head high,
\p You would hunt me like a lion,
\p and again display Your power against me.
\p
\v 17 You produce new witnesses against me
\p and multiply Your anger toward me.
\p Hardships assault me
\p in wave after wave.
\p
\v 18 Why then did You bring me from the womb?
\p Oh, that I had died, and no eye had seen me!
\p
\v 19 If only I had never come to be,
\p but had been carried from the womb to the grave.
\p
\v 20 Are my days not few?
\p Withdraw from me, that I may have a little comfort
\p
\v 21 before I go — never to return —
\p to a land of darkness and gloom,
\p
\v 22 to a land of utter darkness ,

\p
\v 3 Should your babbling put others to silence?
\p Will you scoff without rebuke?
\p
\v 4 You have said, My doctrine is sound,
\p and I am pure in Your sight.
\p
\v 5 But if only God would speak
\p and open His lips against you,
\p
\v 6 and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom,
\p for true wisdom has two sides.
\p Know then that God exacts from you
\p less than your iniquity deserves.
\p
\v 7 Can you fathom the deep things of God
\p or discover the limits of the Almighty?
\p
\v 8 They are higher than the heavens— what can you do?
\p They are deeper than Sheol— what can you know?
\p
\v 9 Their measure is longer than the earth
\p and wider than the sea.
\p
\v 10 If He comes along to imprison you,
\p or convenes a court, who can stop Him?
\p
\v 11 Surely He knows the deceit of men.
\p If He sees iniquity, does He not take note?

\v 14 if you put away the iniquity in your hand,
\p and allow no injustice to dwell in your tents,
\p
\v 15 then indeed you will lift up your face without blemish;
\p you will stand firm and unafraid .
\p
\v 16 For you will forget your misery,
\p recalling it only as waters gone by.
\p
\v 17 Your life will be brighter than noonday;
\p its darkness will be like the morning.
\p
\v 18 You will be secure, because there is hope,

\p Who does not know such things as these?
\p
\v 4 I am a laughingstock to my friends,

\v 1 Indeed, my eyes have seen all this;

\v 2 What you know, I also know;
\p I am not inferior to you.
\p
\v 3 Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty
\p and argue my case before God.
\p
\v 4 You, however, smear with lies;
\p you are all worthless physicians.
\p
\v 5 If only you would remain silent ;
\p for that would be your wisdom!
\p
\v 6 Hear now my argument,
\p and listen to the plea of my lips.
\p
\v 7 Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf
\p or speak deceitfully for Him?
\p
\v 8 Would you show Him partiality
\p or argue in His defense?
\p
\v 9 Would it be well when He examined you ?
\p Could you deceive Him as you would deceive a man?
\p
\v 10 Surely He would rebuke you
\p if you secretly showed partiality .
\p
\v 11 Would His majesty not terrify you ?
\p Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?
\p
\v 12 Your maxims are proverbs of ashes;

\v 15 Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. \f + \fr 13:15 \fr* \ft Or <i>I have no other hope</i>\ft* \f*
\p I will still defend my ways to His face.
\p
\v 16 Moreover, this will be my salvation,
\p for no godless man can appear before Him.
\p
\v 17 Listen carefully to my words;
\p let my declaration ring in your ears.
\p
\v 18 See now, I have prepared my case;
\p I know that I will be vindicated.
\p
\v 19 Can anyone indict me?
\p If so, I will be silent and die.
\p
\v 20 Only grant these two things to me,

\v 21 Withdraw Your hand from me,
\p and do not let Your terror frighten me.
\p
\v 22 Then call me, and I will answer,
\p or let me speak, and You can reply.

\v 23 How many are my iniquities and sins?
\p Reveal to me my transgression and sin.
\p
\v 24 Why do You hide Your face
\p and consider me as Your enemy?
\p
\v 25 Would You frighten a windblown leaf?
\p Would You chase after dry chaff?
\p
\v 26 For You record bitter accusations against me

\p
\v 3 Do You open Your eyes to one like this?
\p Will You bring him into judgment before You?
\p
\v 4 Who can bring out clean from unclean?
\p No one!
\p
\v 5 Since his days are determined
\p and the number of his months is with You,
\p and since You have set limits
\p that he cannot exceed,
\p
\v 6 look away from him and let him rest,
\p so he can enjoy his day as a hired hand.
\p
\v 7 For there is hope for a tree:
\p If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
\p and its tender shoots will not fail.
\p
\v 8 If its roots grow old in the ground
\p and its stump dies in the soil,
\p
\v 9 at the scent of water it will bud

\p

\p If only You would appoint a time for me

\v 24 Distress and anguish terrify him,

\p
\v 25 For he has stretched out his hand against God
\p and has vaunted himself against the Almighty,

\v 26 rushing headlong at Him
\p with a thick, studded shield.
\p
\v 27 Though his face is covered with fat
\p and his waistline bulges with flesh ,

\p for emptiness will be his reward.

\v 32 It will be paid in full before his time,
\p and his branch will not flourish.

\p like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Zophar: Destruction Awaits the Wicked
\p
\v 1 Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
\p
\v 2 So my anxious thoughts compel me to answer,
\p because of the turmoil within me.
\p
\v 3 I have heard a rebuke that insults me,
\p and my understanding prompts a reply.
\p
\v 4 Do you not know that from antiquity,
\p since man was placed on the earth,
\p
\v 5 the triumph of the wicked has been brief
\p and the joy of the godless momentary?
\p
\v 6 Though his arrogance reaches the heavens,
\p and his head touches the clouds,
\p
\v 7 he will perish forever, like his own dung;
\p those who had seen him will ask, Where is he?
\p
\v 8 He will fly away like a dream, never to be found;
\p he will be chased away like a vision in the night.
\p
\v 9 The eye that saw him will see him no more,
\p and his place will no longer behold him.
\p
\v 10 His sons will seek the favor of the poor,
\p for his own hands must return his wealth.
\p
\v 11 The youthful vigor that fills his bones
\p will lie down with him in the dust.
\p
\v 12 Though evil is sweet in his mouth
\p and he conceals it under his tongue,
\p
\v 13 though he cannot bear  to let it go
\p and keeps it in his mouth,
\p
\v 14 yet in his stomach his food sours
\p into the venom of cobras within him.
\p
\v 15 He swallows wealth but vomits it out;
\p God will force it from his stomach.
\p
\v 16 He will suck the poison of cobras;
\p the fangs of a viper will kill him.
\p
\v 17 He will not enjoy the streams,
\p the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
\p
\v 18 He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it;
\p he cannot enjoy the profits of his trading.
\p
\v 19 For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor;
\p he has seized houses he did not build.
\p
\v 20 Because his appetite is never satisfied ,
\p he cannot escape with his treasure.
\p
\v 21 Nothing is left for him to consume;
\p thus his prosperity will not endure.
\p
\v 22 In the midst of his plenty, he will be distressed
\p the full force of misery will come upon him.
\p
\v 23 When he has filled his stomach,
\p God will vent His fury upon him,
\p raining it down on him as he eats.
\p
\v 24 Though he flees from an iron weapon,
\p a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him.
\p
\v 25 It is drawn out of his back,

\p and devour what is left in his tent.
\p
\v 27 The heavens will expose his iniquity,
\p and the earth will rise up against him.
\p
\v 28 The possessions of his house will be removed,

\p let this be your consolation to me.
\p
\v 3 Bear with me while I speak;
\p then, after I have spoken, you may go on mocking.
\p
\v 4 Is my complaint against a man?
\p Then why should I not be impatient?
\p
\v 5 Look at me and be appalled;
\p put your hand over your mouth.
\p
\v 6 When I remember, terror takes hold,
\p and my body trembles in horror.
\p
\v 7 Why do the wicked live on,
\p growing old and increasing in power?
\p
\v 8 Their descendants are established around them ,
\p and their offspring before their eyes.
\p
\v 9 Their homes are safe from fear;
\p no rod of punishment from God is upon them.
\p
\v 10 Their bulls breed without fail;
\p their cows bear calves and do not miscarry.
\p
\v 11 They send forth their little ones like a flock;
\p their children skip about,
\p
\v 12 singing to the tambourine and lyre
\p and making merry at the sound of the flute.
\p
\v 13 They spend their days in prosperity
\p and go down to Sheol in peace. \f + \fr 21:13 \fr* \ft Or <i>in an instant</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 14 Yet they say to God: Leave us alone !
\p For we have no desire to know Your ways.
\p
\v 15 Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him,
\p and what would we gain if we pray to Him?
\p
\v 16 Still, their prosperity is not in their own hands,
\p so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.
\p
\v 17 How often is the lamp of the wicked put out?
\p Does disaster come upon them?
\p Does God, in His anger, apportion destruction?
\p
\v 18 Are they like straw before the wind,
\p like chaff swept away by a storm?
\p
\v 19 It is said that God lays up one’s punishment for his children.
\p Let God repay the man himself, so he will know it.
\p
\v 20 Let his eyes see his own destruction;
\p let him drink for himself the wrath of the Almighty.
\p
\v 21 For what does he care about his household after him,
\p when the number of his months has run out?
\p
\v 22 Can anyone teach knowledge to God,
\p since He judges those on high?
\p
\v 23 One man dies full of vigor ,
\p completely secure and at ease.
\p
\v 24 His body is well nourished , \f + \fr 21:24 \fr* \ft Literally <i>His pails are full of milk</i>\ft* \f*
\p and his bones are rich with marrow.
\p
\v 25 Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul,
\p having never tasted prosperity.
\p
\v 26 But together they lie down in the dust,
\p and worms cover them both.
\p
\v 27 Behold, I know your thoughts full well,

\p
\v 28 For you say, Where now is the nobleman’s house,
\p and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?
\p
\v 29 Have you never asked those who travel the roads?
\p Do you not accept their reports?
\p
\v 30 Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of calamity,
\p delivered from the day of wrath.
\p
\v 31 Who denounces his behavior to his face?
\p Who repays him for what he has done?
\p
\v 32 He is carried to the grave,
\p and watch is kept over his tomb.
\p
\v 33 The clods of the valley are sweet to him;
\p everyone follows behind him,
\p and those before him are without number.

\p
\v 3 Does it delight the Almighty that you are righteous?
\p Does He profit if your ways are blameless?
\p
\v 4 Is it for your reverence that He rebukes you
\p and enters into judgment against you?
\p
\v 5 Is not your wickedness great?
\p Are not your iniquities endless ?
\p
\v 6 For you needlessly demanded security from your brothers
\p and deprived the naked of their clothing.
\p
\v 7 You gave no water to the weary
\p and withheld food from the famished,
\p
\v 8 while the land belonged to a mighty man,
\p and a man of honor lived on it.
\p
\v 9 You sent widows away empty-handed,

\v 10 Therefore snares surround you,

\v 11 it is so dark you cannot see,

\p
\v 12 Is not God as high as the heavens?
\p Look at the highest stars, how lofty they are!
\p

\p
\v 21 Reconcile now and be at peace with Him;

\p
\v 22 Receive instruction from His mouth,

\p
\v 23 If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored.
\p If you remove injustice from your tents

\v 24 and consign your gold to the dust

\p
\v 26 Surely then you will delight in the Almighty

\p
\v 27 You will pray to Him, and He will hear you,

\p
\v 28 Your decisions will be carried out

\v 29 When men are brought low and you say, Lift them up!

\p
\v 3 If only I knew where to find Him,

\p

\v 5 I would learn how He would answer,

\v 6 Would He contend with me in His great power?
\p No, He would certainly take note of me.

\v 7 Then an upright man could reason with Him,

\p
\v 2 Men move boundary stones;
\p they pasture stolen flocks.
\p
\v 3 They drive away the donkey of the fatherless
\p and take the widow’s ox in pledge.
\p
\v 4 They push the needy off the road
\p and force all the poor of the land into hiding.
\p
\v 5 Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert,
\p the poor go to work foraging for food;
\p the wasteland is food for their children.
\p
\v 6 They gather fodder in the fields
\p and glean the vineyards of the wicked.
\p
\v 7 Without clothing, they spend the night naked;
\p they have no covering against the cold.
\p
\v 8 Drenched by mountain rains,
\p they huddle against the rocks for want of shelter.
\p
\v 9 The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast;
\p the nursing child of the poor is seized for a debt.
\p
\v 10 Without clothing, they wander about naked.
\p They carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.
\p
\v 11 They crush olives within their walls;
\p they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty.
\p
\v 12 From the city, men groan,
\p and the souls of the wounded cry out,
\p yet God charges no one with wrongdoing.
\p
\v 13 Then there are those who rebel against the light,

\p
\v 14 When daylight is gone, the murderer rises
\p to kill the poor and needy;
\p in the night he is like a thief.
\p
\v 15 The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight.
\p Thinking, No eye will see me, he covers his face.
\p
\v 16 In the dark they dig through houses;
\p by day they shut themselves in
\p never to experience the light.
\p
\v 17 For to them, deep darkness is their morning;
\p surely they are friends with the terrors of darkness!
\p
\v 18 They are but foam on the surface of the water;
\p their portion of the land is cursed,
\p so that no one turns toward their vineyards.
\p
\v 19 As drought and heat consume the melting snow,
\p so Sheol steals those who have sinned.
\p

\p and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.
\p
\v 11 For those who heard me called me blessed,

\v 12 because I rescued the poor who cried out
\p and the fatherless who had no helper.
\p
\v 13 The dying man  blessed me,

\p
\v 14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;

\p
\v 15 I served as eyes to the blind

\p
\v 16 I was a father to the needy,

\p
\v 17 I shattered the fangs of the unjust
\p and snatched the prey from his teeth.
\p
\v 18 So I thought: I will die in my nest
\p and multiply my days as the sand.
\p
\v 19 My roots will spread out to the waters,
\p and the dew will rest nightly on my branches.
\p
\v 20 My glory is ever new within me,

\p
\v 21 Men listened to me with expectation,

\p
\v 22 After my words, they spoke no more;
\p my speech settled on them like dew.
\p
\v 23 They waited for me as for rain
\p and drank in my words like spring showers.
\p
\v 24 If I smiled at them, they did not believe it;

\v 25 I chose their course and presided as chief.

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Job’s Final Appeal
\p
\v 1 I have made a covenant with my eyes.
\p How then could I gaze with desire at a virgin?
\p
\v 2 For what is the allotment of God from above,
\p or the heritage from the Almighty on high?
\p
\v 3 Does not disaster come to the unjust
\p and calamity to the workers of iniquity?
\p
\v 4 Does He not see my ways
\p and count my every step?
\p
\v 5 If I have walked in falsehood
\p or my foot has rushed to deceit,
\p
\v 6 let God weigh me with honest scales,
\p that He may know my integrity.
\p
\v 7 If my steps have turned from the path,
\p if my heart has followed my eyes,
\p or if impurity has stuck to my hands,
\p
\v 8 then may another eat what I have sown,
\p and may my crops be uprooted.
\p
\v 9 If my heart has been enticed by my neighbor’s wife,
\p or I have lurked at his door,
\p
\v 10 then may my own wife grind grain for another,
\p and may other men sleep with her.
\p
\v 11 For that would be a heinous crime,
\p an iniquity to be judged.
\p
\v 12 For it is a fire that burns down to Abaddon; \f + \fr 31:12 \fr* \ft <i>Abaddon</i> means <i>Destruction</i>.\ft* \f*
\p it would root out my entire harvest.
\p
\v 13 If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant
\p when they made a complaint against me,
\p
\v 14 what will I do when God rises to judge?
\p How will I answer when called to account?
\p
\v 15 Did not He who made me in the womb also make them?
\p Did not the same One form us in the womb?
\p
\v 16 If I have denied the desires of the poor
\p or allowed the widow’s eyes to fail,
\p
\v 17 if I have eaten my morsel alone,
\p not sharing it with the fatherless —
\p
\v 18 though from my youth I reared him as would a father,
\p and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow —
\p
\v 19 if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing,
\p or a needy man without a cloak,
\p
\v 20 if his heart has not blessed me \f + \fr 31:20 \fr* \ft Hebrew <i>if his loins have not blessed me</i>\ft* \f*

\p
\v 22 then may my arm fall from my shoulder
\p and be torn from its socket.
\p
\v 23 For calamity from God terrifies me,
\p and His splendor I cannot overpower.
\p
\v 24 If I have put my trust in gold
\p or called pure gold my security,
\p
\v 25 if I have rejoiced in my great wealth
\p because my hand had gained so much,
\p
\v 26 if I have beheld the sun \f + \fr 31:26 \fr* \ft Hebrew <i>the light</i>\ft* \f* in its radiance
\p or the moon moving in splendor,
\p
\v 27 so that my heart was secretly enticed
\p and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,
\p
\v 28 this would also be an iniquity to be judged,
\p for I would have denied God on high.
\p
\v 29 If I have rejoiced in my enemy’s ruin,
\p or exulted when evil befell him —
\p
\v 30 I have not allowed my mouth to sin
\p by asking for his life with a curse —
\p
\v 31 if the men of my house have not said,
\p Who is there who has not had his fill?
\p
\v 32 but no stranger had to lodge on the street,
\p for my door has been open to the traveler —

\p so that I kept silent
\p and would not go outside —
\p
\v 35 Oh, that I had one to hear me!
\p Here is my signature.
\p Let the Almighty answer me;
\p let my accuser compose an indictment.
\p
\v 36 Surely I would carry it on my shoulder
\p and wear it like a crown.
\p
\v 37 I would give account of all my steps;

\p
\v 38 if my land cries out against me
\p and its furrows weep together,

\v 39 if I have devoured its produce without payment
\p or broken the spirit of its tenants,

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Elihu Rebukes Job’s Friends
\p
\v 1 So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
\p
\v 2 This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God,
\v 3 and he burned with anger against Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.
\p
\v 4 Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he .
\v 5 But when he saw that the three men had no further reply , his anger was kindled.
\v 6 So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared:
\p I am young in years,
\p while you are old;
\p that is why I was timid and afraid
\p to tell you what I know .
\p
\v 7 I thought that age should speak,
\p and many years should teach wisdom.
\p
\v 8 But there is a spirit \f + \fr 32:8 \fr* \ft Or <i>the Spirit</i>; similarly in verse 18\ft* \f* in a man,
\p the breath of the Almighty,
\p that gives him understanding.
\p
\v 9 It is not only the old \f + \fr 32:9 \fr* \ft Or <i>many</i> or <i>great</i>\ft* \f* who are wise,
\p or the elderly who understand justice.
\p
\v 10 Therefore I say, Listen to me;
\p I too will declare what I know.
\p
\v 11 Indeed, I waited while you spoke;
\p I listened to your reasoning;
\p as you searched for words,
\p
\v 12 I paid you full attention .
\p But no one proved Job wrong;
\p not one of you rebutted his arguments.
\p
\v 13 So do not claim, We have found wisdom;
\p let God, not man, refute him.
\p
\v 14 But Job has not directed his words against me,
\p and I will not answer him with your arguments.
\p
\v 15 Job’s friends are dismayed, with no more to say;
\p words have escaped them.
\p
\v 16 Must I wait, now that they are silent ,
\p now that they stand and no longer reply?
\p
\v 17 I too will answer;
\p yes, I will declare what I know.
\p
\v 18 For I am full of words,
\p and my spirit within me compels me.
\p
\v 19 Behold, my belly is like unvented wine;
\p it is about to burst like a new wineskin.
\p
\v 20 I must speak and find relief
\p I must open my lips and respond.
\p
\v 21 I will be partial to no one,
\p nor will I flatter any man.
\p
\v 22 For I do not know how to flatter,
\p or my Maker would remove me in an instant.
\c 33
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Elihu Rebukes Job
\p
\v 1 But now, O Job, hear my speech,
\p and listen to all my words.
\p
\v 2 Behold , I will open my mouth;
\p my address is on the tip of my tongue.
\p
\v 3 My words are from an upright heart,
\p and my lips speak sincerely what I know.
\p
\v 4 The Spirit of God has made me,
\p and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
\p
\v 5 Refute me if you can;
\p prepare your case and confront me .
\p
\v 6 I am just like you before God;
\p I was also formed from clay.
\p
\v 7 Surely no fear of me should terrify you;
\p nor will my hand be heavy upon you.
\p
\v 8 Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
\p and I have heard these very words:
\p
\v 9 I am pure, without transgression;
\p I am clean, with no iniquity in me.
\p
\v 10 Yet God finds occasions against me;
\p He counts me as His enemy.
\p
\v 11 He puts my feet in the stocks;
\p He watches over all my paths.
\p
\v 12 Behold, you are not right in this matter.
\p I will answer you, for God is greater than man.
\p
\v 13 Why do you complain to Him
\p that He answers nothing a man asks? \f + \fr 33:13 \fr* \ft Or <i>that He answers for none of His actions</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 14 For God speaks in one way and in another,
\p yet no one notices.
\p
\v 15 In a dream,
\p in a vision in the night,
\p when deep sleep falls upon men
\p as they slumber on their beds,
\p
\v 16 He opens their ears
\p and terrifies them with warnings
\p
\v 17 to turn a man from wrongdoing
\p and keep him from pride,
\p
\v 18 to preserve his soul from the Pit
\p and his life from perishing by the sword.
\p
\v 19 A man is also chastened on his bed
\p with pain and constant distress in his bones,
\p
\v 20 so that he detests his bread,
\p and his soul loathes his favorite food.
\p
\v 21 His flesh wastes away from sight,
\p and his hidden bones protrude.
\p
\v 22 He draws near to the Pit,
\p and his life to the messengers of death.
\p
\v 23 Yet if there is a messenger on his side,
\p one mediator in a thousand,
\p to tell a man what is right for him,
\p
\v 24 to be gracious to him and say,
\p Spare him from going down to the Pit;
\p I have found his ransom,
\p
\v 25 then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s;
\p he returns to the days of his youth.
\p
\v 26 He prays to God and finds favor;
\p he sees God’s face and shouts for joy,
\p and God restores His righteousness
\p to that man.
\p
\v 27 Then he sings before \f + \fr 33:27 \fr* \ft Or <i>Then he looks upon</i>\ft* \f* men
\p with these words:
\p I have sinned and perverted what was right;
\p yet I did not get what I deserved
\p
\v 28 He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit,
\p and I will live to see the light.
\p
\v 29 Behold, all these things God does to a man,
\p two or even three times,
\p
\v 30 to bring back his soul from the Pit,
\p that he may be enlightened with the light of life.
\p
\v 31 Pay attention, Job, and listen to me;
\p be silent, and I will speak.
\p
\v 32 But if you have something to say, answer me;
\p speak up, for I would like to vindicate you.
\p
\v 33 But if not, then listen to me;
\p be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Elihu Confirms God’s Justice
\p
\v 1 Then Elihu continued :
\p
\v 2 Hear my words, O wise men;
\p give ear to me, O men of learning.
\p
\v 3 For the ear tests words
\p as the mouth tastes food.
\p
\v 4 Let us choose for ourselves what is right;
\p let us learn together what is good.
\p
\v 5 For Job has declared, I am righteous,
\p yet God has deprived me of justice.
\p
\v 6 Would I lie about my case?
\p My wound is incurable,
\p though I am without transgression.
\p
\v 7 What man is like Job,
\p who drinks up derision like water?
\p
\v 8 He keeps company with evildoers
\p and walks with wicked men.
\p
\v 9 For he has said, It profits a man nothing
\p that he should delight in God.
\p
\v 10 Therefore listen to me,
\p O men of understanding.
\p Far be it from God to do wrong,
\p and from the Almighty to act unjustly.
\p
\v 11 For according to a man’s deeds He repays him;
\p according to a man’s ways He brings consequences.
\p
\v 12 Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly,
\p and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
\p
\v 13 Who gave Him charge over the earth?
\p Who appointed Him over the whole world?
\p
\v 14 If He were to set His heart to it
\p and withdraw His Spirit and breath ,
\p
\v 15 all flesh would perish together
\p and mankind would return to the dust.
\p
\v 16 If you have understanding, hear this;
\p listen to my words.
\p
\v 17 Could one who hates justice govern?
\p Will you condemn the just and mighty One,
\p
\v 18 who says to kings, You are worthless!
\p and to nobles, You are wicked,’
\p
\v 19 who is not partial to princes
\p and does not favor rich over poor?
\p For they are all the work of His hands.
\p
\v 20 They die in an instant,
\p in the middle of the night.
\p The people convulse and pass away;
\p the mighty are removed without human hand.
\p
\v 21 For His eyes are on the ways of a man,
\p and He sees his every step.
\p
\v 22 There is no darkness or deep shadow
\p where the workers of iniquity can hide.
\p
\v 23 For God need not examine a man further
\p or have him approach for judgment.
\p
\v 24 He shatters the mighty without inquiry
\p and sets up others in their place.
\p
\v 25 Therefore, He recognizes their deeds;
\p He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
\p
\v 26 He strikes them for their wickedness
\p in full view,
\p
\v 27 because  they turned aside from Him
\p and had no regard for any of His ways.
\p
\v 28 They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him,
\p and He heard the outcry of the afflicted.
\p
\v 29 But when He remains silent, who can condemn Him?
\p When He hides His face, who can see Him?
\p Yet He watches over both man and nation ,
\p
\v 30 that godless men should not rule
\p or lay snares for the people.
\p
\v 31 Suppose someone says to God,
\p I have endured my punishment; I will offend no more.
\p
\v 32 Teach me what I cannot see;
\p if I have done wrong, I will not do it again.
\p
\v 33 Should God repay you on your own terms
\p when you have disavowed Him ?
\p You must choose, not I;
\p so tell me what you know.
\p
\v 34 Men of understanding will declare to me,
\p and the wise men who hear me will say:
\p
\v 35 Job speaks without knowledge;
\p his words lack insight.
\p
\v 36 If only Job were tried to the utmost
\p for answering like a wicked man.
\p
\v 37 For he adds rebellion to his sin;
\p he claps his hands among us
\p and multiplies his words against God.
\c 35
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Elihu Recalls God’s Justice
\p
\v 1 And Elihu went on to say:
\p
\v 2 Do you think this is just?
\p You say, I am more righteous than God.’ \f + \fr 35:2 \fr* \ft Or <i>‘I am righteous before God.’</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 3 For you ask, What does it profit me,
\p and what benefit do I gain apart from sin?’
\p
\v 4 I will reply to you
\p and to your friends as well.
\p
\v 5 Look to the heavens and see;
\p gaze at the clouds high above you.
\p
\v 6 If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him?
\p If you multiply your transgressions, what do you do to Him?
\p
\v 7 If you are righteous, what do you give Him,
\p or what does He receive from your hand?
\p
\v 8 Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself,
\p and your righteousness only a son of man.
\p
\v 9 Men cry out under great oppression;
\p they plead for relief from the arm of the mighty.
\p
\v 10 But no one asks, Where is God my Maker,
\p who gives us songs in the night,
\p
\v 11 who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth
\p and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?
\p
\v 12 There they cry out, but He does not answer,
\p because of the pride of evil men.
\p
\v 13 Surely God does not listen to empty pleas,
\p and the Almighty does not take note of it.
\p
\v 14 How much less, then, when you say that you do not see Him,
\p that your case is before Him and you must wait for Him,
\p
\v 15 and further, that in His anger He has not punished
\p or taken much notice of folly!
\p
\v 16 So Job opens his mouth in vain
\p and multiplies words without knowledge.

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Elihu Describes God’s Power
\p
\v 1 And Elihu continued :
\p
\v 2 Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you
\p that there is more to be said on God’s behalf.
\p
\v 3 I get my knowledge from afar,
\p and I will ascribe justice to my Maker.
\p
\v 4 For truly my words are free of falsehood;
\p one perfect in knowledge is with you.
\p
\v 5 Indeed, God is mighty, but He despises no one;
\p He is mighty in strength of understanding.
\p
\v 6 He does not keep the wicked alive,
\p but He grants justice to the afflicted.
\p
\v 7 He does not take His eyes off the righteous,
\p but He enthrones them with kings
\p and exalts them forever.
\p
\v 8 And if men are bound with chains,
\p caught in cords of affliction,
\p
\v 9 then He tells them their deeds
\p and how arrogantly they have transgressed.
\p
\v 10 He opens their ears to correction
\p and commands that they turn from iniquity.
\p
\v 11 If they obey and serve Him,
\p then they end their days in prosperity
\p and their years in happiness.
\p
\v 12 But if they do not obey,
\p then they perish by the sword \f + \fr 36:12 \fr* \ft Or <i>they will cross the river of death</i>\ft* \f*
\p and die without knowledge.
\p
\v 13 The godless in heart harbor resentment;
\p even when He binds them, they do not cry for help.
\p
\v 14 They die in their youth,
\p among the male shrine prostitutes.
\p
\v 15 God rescues the afflicted by their affliction \f + \fr 36:15 \fr* \ft Or <i>in their affliction</i>\ft* \f*
\p and opens their ears in oppression.
\p
\v 16 Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress
\p to a spacious  and broad place,
\p to a table full of richness.
\p
\v 17 But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked;
\p judgment and justice have seized you.
\p
\v 18 Be careful that no one lures you with riches;
\p do not let a large bribe lead you astray.
\p
\v 19 Can your wealth \f + \fr 36:19 \fr* \ft Or <i>your cry for help</i>\ft* \f* or all your mighty effort
