\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Judah’s Rebellion
\r <br /><span class=|cross|>(<a href =|../2_chronicles/28.htm#5|>2 Chronicles 28:5–15</a>)</span>
\p
\v 1 This is the vision concerning Judah and Jerusalem that Isaiah son of Amoz saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
\p
\v 2 Listen, O heavens, and give ear, O earth,
\p for the LORD has spoken:
\p I have raised children and brought them up,
\p but they have rebelled against Me.
\p
\v 3 The ox knows its owner,
\p and the donkey its master’s manger,
\p but Israel does not know;
\p My people do not understand.
\p
\v 4 Alas, O sinful nation,
\p a people laden with iniquity,
\p a brood of evildoers,
\p children who act corruptly!
\p They have forsaken the LORD;
\p they have despised the Holy One of Israel
\p and turned their backs on Him.
\p
\v 5 Why do you want more beatings?
\p Why do you keep rebelling?
\p Your head has a massive wound,
\p and your whole heart is afflicted.
\p
\v 6 From the sole of your foot to the top of your head,
\p there is no soundness—
\p only wounds and welts and festering sores
\p neither cleansed nor bandaged nor soothed with oil.
\p
\v 7 Your land is desolate;
\p your cities are burned with fire.
\p Foreigners devour your fields before you —
\p a desolation demolished by strangers.
\p
\v 8 And the Daughter of Zion is abandoned
\p like a shelter in a vineyard,
\p like a shack in a cucumber field,
\p like a city besieged.
\p
\v 9 Unless the LORD of Hosts
\p had left us a few survivors, \f + \fr 1:9 \fr* \ft LXX <i>had left us descendants</i>\ft* \f*
\p we would have become like Sodom,
\p we would have resembled Gomorrah. \f + \fr 1:9 \fr* \ft Cited in Romans 9:29\ft* \f*
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Meaningless Offerings
\p
\v 10 Hear the word of the LORD,
\p you rulers of Sodom;
\p listen to the instruction of our God,
\p you people of Gomorrah!
\p
\v 11 What good to Me is your multitude of sacrifices?
\p says the LORD.
\p I am full from the burnt offerings of rams
\p and the fat of well-fed cattle;
\p I take no delight in the blood of bulls
\p and lambs and goats.
\p
\v 12 When you come to appear before Me,
\p who has required this of you—
\p this trampling of My courts?
\p
\v 13 Bring your worthless offerings no more;
\p your incense is detestable to Me.
\p New Moons, Sabbaths, and convocations —
\p I cannot endure iniquity in a solemn assembly.
\p
\v 14 I hate your New Moons
\p and your appointed feasts.
\p They have become a burden to Me;
\p I am weary of bearing them.
\p
\v 15 When you spread out your hands in prayer,
\p I will hide My eyes from you;
\p even though you multiply your prayers,
\p I will not listen.
\p Your hands are covered with blood.
\p
\v 16 Wash and cleanse yourselves.
\p Remove your evil deeds from My sight.
\p Stop doing evil!
\p
\v 17 Learn to do right;
\p seek justice and correct the oppressor. \f + \fr 1:17 \fr* \ft Or <i>and encourage the oppressed</i>\ft* \f*
\p Defend the fatherless
\p and plead the case of the widow.
\p
\v 18 Come now, let us reason together,
\p says the LORD.
\p Though your sins are like scarlet,
\p they will be as white as snow;
\p though they are as red as crimson,
\p they will become like wool.
\p
\v 19 If you are willing and obedient,
\p you will eat the best of the land.
\p
\v 20 But if you resist and rebel,
\p you will be devoured by the sword.
\p For the mouth of the LORD has spoken.
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>The Corruption of Zion
\p
\v 21 See how the faithful city has become a harlot!
\p She once was full of justice;
\p righteousness resided within her,
\p but now only murderers!
\p
\v 22 Your silver has become dross;
\p your fine wine is diluted with water.
\p
\v 23 Your rulers are rebels,
\p friends of thieves.
\p They all love bribes
\p and chasing after rewards.
\p They do not defend the fatherless,
\p and the plea of the widow never comes before them.
\p
\v 24 Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts,
\p the Mighty One of Israel, declares:
\p Ah, I will be relieved of My foes
\p and avenge Myself on My enemies.
\p
\v 25 I will turn My hand against you;
\p I will thoroughly purge your dross;
\p I will remove all your impurities.
\p
\v 26 I will restore your judges as at first,
\p and your counselors as at the beginning.
\p After that you will be called the City of Righteousness,
\p the Faithful City.
\p
\v 27 Zion will be redeemed with justice,
\p her repentant ones with righteousness.
\p
\v 28 But rebels and sinners will together be shattered,
\p and those who forsake the LORD will perish.
\p
\v 29 Surely you will be ashamed of the sacred oaks
\p in which you have delighted;
\p you will be embarrassed by the gardens
\p that you have chosen.
\p
\v 30 For you will become like an oak whose leaves are withered,
\p like a garden without water.
\p
\v 31 The strong man will become tinder
\p and his work will be a spark;
\p both will burn together,
\p with no one to quench the flames.

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>The Mountain of the House of the LORD
\r <br /><span class=|cross|>(<a href =|../micah/4.htm|>Micah 4:1–5</a>)</span>
\p
\v 1 This is the message that was revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
\p
\v 2 In the last days the mountain of the house of the LORD
\p will be established as the chief of the mountains;
\p it will be raised above the hills,
\p and all nations will stream to it.
\p
\v 3 And many peoples will come and say:
\p Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,
\p to the house of the God of Jacob.
\p He will teach us His ways
\p so that we may walk in His paths.
\p For the law will go forth from Zion,
\p and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
\p
\v 4 Then He will judge between the nations
\p and arbitrate for many peoples.
\p They will beat their swords into plowshares
\p and their spears into pruning hooks.
\p Nation will no longer take up the sword against nation,
\p nor train anymore for war.
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>The Day of Reckoning
\p
\v 5 Come, O house of Jacob,
\p let us walk in the light of the LORD.
\p
\v 6 For You have abandoned Your people,
\p the house of Jacob,
\p because they are filled
\p with influences from the east;
\p they are soothsayers like the Philistines;
\p they strike hands with the children of foreigners.
\p
\v 7 Their land is full of silver and gold,
\p with no limit to their treasures;
\p their land is full of horses,
\p with no limit to their chariots.
\p
\v 8 Their land is full of idols;
\p they bow down to the work of their hands,
\p to what their fingers have made.
\p
\v 9 So mankind is brought low,
\p and man is humbled —
\p do not forgive them!
\p
\v 10 Go into the rocks
\p and hide in the dust
\p from the terror of the LORD
\p and the splendor of His majesty.
\p
\v 11 The proud look of man will be humbled,
\p and the loftiness of men brought low;
\p the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.
\p
\v 12 For the Day of the LORD of Hosts
\p will come against all the proud and lofty,
\p against all that is exalted—
\p it will be humbled—
\p
\v 13 against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up,
\p against all the oaks of Bashan,
\p
\v 14 against all the tall mountains,
\p against all the high hills,
\p
\v 15 against every high tower,
\p against every fortified wall,
\p
\v 16 against every ship of Tarshish, \f + \fr 2:16 \fr* \ft Or <i>every ship of trade</i>\ft* \f*
\p and against every stately vessel.
\p
\v 17 So the pride of man will be brought low,
\p and the loftiness of men will be humbled;
\p the LORD alone will be exalted in that day,
\p
\v 18 and the idols will vanish completely.
\p
\v 19 Men will flee to caves in the rocks
\p and holes in the ground,
\p away from the terror of the LORD
\p and from the splendor of His majesty,
\p when He rises to shake the earth.
\p
\v 20 In that day men will cast away
\p to the moles and bats
\p their idols of silver and gold —
\p the idols they made to worship.
\p
\v 21 They will flee to caverns in the rocks
\p and crevices in the cliffs,
\p away from the terror of the LORD
\p and from the splendor of His majesty,
\p when He rises to shake the earth.
\p
\v 22 Put no more trust in man,
\p who has only the breath in his nostrils.
\p Of what account is he?
\c 3
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Judgment on Jerusalem and Judah
\p
\v 1 For behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts
\p is about to remove
\p from Jerusalem and Judah
\p both supply \f + \fr 3:1 \fr* \ft Hebrew <i>staff</i>\ft* \f* and support:
\p the whole supply of food  and water,
\p
\v 2 the mighty man and the warrior ,
\p the judge and the prophet,
\p the soothsayer and the elder,
\p
\v 3 the commander of fifty and the dignitary ,
\p the counselor, the cunning magician, and the clever enchanter.
\p
\v 4 I will make mere lads their leaders,
\p and children will rule over them.
\p
\v 5 The people will oppress one another,
\p man against man, neighbor against neighbor;
\p the young will rise up against the old,
\p and the base against the honorable.
\p
\v 6 A man will seize his brother
\p within his father’s house:
\p You have a cloak— you be our leader!
\p Take charge of this heap of rubble.
\p
\v 7 On that day he will cry aloud :
\p I am not a healer. \f + \fr 3:7 \fr* \ft Or <i>binder of wounds</i>\ft* \f*
\p I have no food or clothing in my house.
\p Do not make me leader of the people!
\p
\v 8 For Jerusalem has stumbled
\p and Judah has fallen
\p because they spoke and acted against the LORD,
\p defying His glorious presence. \f + \fr 3:8 \fr* \ft Hebrew <i>defying the eyes of His glory</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 9 The expression on their faces testifies against them,
\p and like Sodom they flaunt their sin;
\p they do not conceal it.
\p Woe to them,
\p for they have brought disaster upon themselves.
\p
\v 10 Tell the righteous it will be well with them,
\p for they will enjoy the fruit of their labor.
\p
\v 11 Woe to the wicked; disaster is upon them!
\p For they will be repaid with what their hands have done
\p
\v 12 Youths oppress My people,
\p and women rule over them.
\p O My people, your guides mislead you;
\p they turn you from your paths.
\p
\v 13 The LORD arises to contend;
\p He stands to judge the people.
\p
\v 14 The LORD brings this charge
\p against the elders and leaders of His people:
\p You have devoured the vineyard;
\p the plunder of the poor is in your houses.
\p
\v 15 Why do you crush My people
\p and grind the faces of the poor?
\p declares the Lord GOD of Hosts.
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>A Warning to the Daughters of Zion
\p
\v 16 The LORD also says:
\p Because the daughters of Zion are haughty —
\p walking with heads held high
\p and wanton eyes,
\p prancing and skipping as they go,
\p jingling the bracelets on their ankles —
\p
\v 17 the Lord will bring sores
\p on the heads of the daughters of Zion,
\p and the LORD will make their foreheads bare. \f + \fr 3:17 \fr* \ft Or <i>will uncover their secret parts</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 18 In that day the Lord will take away their finery:
\p their anklets and headbands and crescents;
\p
\v 19 their pendants, bracelets, and veils;
\p
\v 20 their headdresses, ankle chains, and sashes;
\p their perfume bottles and charms;
\p
\v 21 their signet rings and nose rings;
\p
\v 22 their festive robes, capes, cloaks, and purses;
\p
\v 23 and their mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and shawls.
\p
\v 24 Instead of fragrance
\p there will be a stench;
\p instead of a belt, a rope;
\p instead of styled hair, baldness;
\p instead of fine clothing, sackcloth ;
\p instead of beauty, shame. \f + \fr 3:24 \fr* \ft DSS; MT <i>branding</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 25 Your men will fall by the sword,
\p and your warriors in battle.
\p
\v 26 And the gates of Zion will lament and mourn;
\p destitute, she will sit on the ground.
\c 4
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>A Remnant in Zion
\p
\v 1 In that day seven women
\p will take hold of one man and say,
\p We will eat our own bread
\p and provide our own clothes.
\p Just let us be called by your name.
\p Take away our disgrace!
\p
\v 2 On that day the Branch of the LORD
\p will be beautiful and glorious,
\p and the fruit of the land
\p will be the pride and glory of Israel’s survivors.
\p
\v 3 Whoever remains in Zion
\p and whoever is left in Jerusalem
\p will be called holy—
\p all in Jerusalem who are recorded among the living—
\p
\v 4 when the Lord has washed away
\p the filth of the daughters of Zion
\p and cleansed the bloodstains from the heart of Jerusalem
\p by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.
\p
\v 5 Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion
\p and over her assemblies
\p a cloud of smoke by day
\p and a glowing flame of fire by night.
\p For over all the glory
\p there will be a canopy,
\p
\v 6 a shelter to give shade
\p from the heat by day,
\p and a refuge and hiding place
\p from the storm and the rain.

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>The Song of the Vineyard
\r <br /><span class=|cross|>(<a href =|../luke/13.htm#6|>Luke 13:6–9</a>)</span>
\p
\v 1 I will sing for my beloved a song of his vineyard:
\p My beloved had a vineyard
\p on a very fertile hill.
\p
\v 2 He dug it up and cleared the stones
\p and planted the finest vines.
\p He built a watchtower in the middle
\p and dug out a winepress as well.
\p He waited for the vineyard to yield good grapes,
\p but the fruit it produced was sour!
\p
\v 3 And now, O dwellers of Jerusalem
\p and men of Judah,
\p I exhort you to judge
\p between Me and My vineyard.
\p
\v 4 What more could have been done for My vineyard
\p than I have done for it?
\p Why, when I expected sweet grapes,
\p did it bring forth sour fruit?
\p
\v 5 Now I will tell you  what I am about to do to My vineyard:
\p I will take away its hedge,
\p and it will be consumed;
\p I will tear down its wall,
\p and it will be trampled.
\p
\v 6 I will make it a wasteland,
\p neither pruned nor cultivated,
\p and thorns and briers will grow up.
\p I will command the clouds
\p that rain shall not fall on it.
\p
\v 7 For the vineyard of the LORD of Hosts
\p is the house of Israel,
\p and the men of Judah
\p are the plant of His delight.
\p He looked for justice,
\p but saw bloodshed;
\p for righteousness,
\p but heard a cry of distress.
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Woes to the Wicked
\p
\v 8 Woe to you who add house to house
\p and join field to field
\p until no place is left
\p and you live alone in the land.
\p
\v 9 I heard the LORD of Hosts declare:
\p Surely many houses will become desolate,
\p great mansions  left unoccupied.
\p
\v 10 For ten acres of vineyard
\p will yield but a bath of wine, \f + \fr 5:10 \fr* \ft Literally <i>ten yoke of vineyard will yield a bath</i>; that is, the area ten yoke of oxen can plow in a day will yield approximately 5.8 gallons or 22 liters of wine.\ft* \f*
\p and a homer of seed
\p only an ephah of grain. \f + \fr 5:10 \fr* \ft Literally <i>and a homer of seed will yield an ephah</i>; that is, a homer of seed (approximately 6.24 bushels or 220 liters) will yield a tenth of its weight in grain.\ft* \f*
\p
\v 11 Woe to those who rise early in the morning
\p in pursuit of strong drink,
\p who linger into the evening,
\p to be inflamed by wine.
\p
\v 12 At their feasts are the lyre and harp,
\p tambourines and flutes and wine.
\p They disregard the actions of the LORD
\p and fail to see the work of His hands.
\p
\v 13 Therefore My people will go into exile
\p for their lack of understanding;
\p their dignitaries are starving
\p and their masses are parched with thirst.
\p
\v 14 Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat
\p and opens wide its enormous jaws,
\p and down go Zion’s nobles and masses,
\p her revelers and carousers
\p
\v 15 So mankind will be brought low, and each man humbled;
\p the arrogant will lower their eyes.
\p
\v 16 But the LORD of Hosts will be exalted by His justice,
\p and the holy God will show Himself holy in righteousness.
\p
\v 17 Lambs will graze as in their own pastures,
\p and strangers \f + \fr 5:17 \fr* \ft LXX <i>lambs</i>\ft* \f* will feed in the ruins of the wealthy.
\p
\v 18 Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of deceit
\p and pull sin along with cart ropes,
\p
\v 19 to those who say, Let Him hurry and hasten His work
\p so that we may see it!
\p Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel come
\p so that we may know it!
\p
\v 20 Woe to those who call evil good
\p and good evil,
\p who turn darkness to light
\p and light to darkness,
\p who replace bitter with sweet
\p and sweet with bitter.
\p
\v 21 Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes
\p and clever in their own sight.
\p
\v 22 Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine
\p and champions in mixing strong drink,
\p
\v 23 who acquit the guilty for a bribe
\p and deprive the innocent of justice.
\p
\v 24 Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes the straw,
\p and as dry grass shrivels in the flame,
\p so their roots will decay
\p and their blossoms will blow away like dust;
\p for they have rejected the instruction of the LORD of Hosts
\p and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
\p
\v 25 Therefore the anger of the LORD burns against His people;
\p His hand is raised against them to strike them down.
\p The mountains quake,
\p and the corpses lie like refuse in the streets.
\p Despite all this, His anger is not turned away;
\p His hand is still upraised.
\p
\v 26 He lifts a banner for the distant nations
\p and whistles for those at the ends of the earth.
\p Behold— how speedily and swiftly they come!
\p
\v 27 None of them grows weary or stumbles;
\p no one slumbers or sleeps.
\p No belt is loose
\p and no sandal strap is broken.
\p
\v 28 Their arrows are sharpened,
\p and all their bows are strung.
\p The hooves of their horses are like flint;
\p their chariot wheels are like a whirlwind.
\p
\v 29 Their roaring is like that of a lion;
\p they roar like young lions.
\p They growl and seize their prey;
\p they carry it away, and no one can rescue it.
\p
\v 30 In that day they will roar over it,
\p like the roaring of the sea.
\p If one looks over the land,
\p he will see darkness and distress;
\p even the light will be obscured by clouds.

\p
\v 1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted; and the train of His robe \f + \fr 6:1 \fr* \ft Or <i>the hem of His robe</i>\ft* \f* filled the temple.
\v 2 Above Him stood seraphim, each having six wings With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying.
\v 3 And they were calling out to one another :
\p Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hosts;
\p all the earth is full of His glory.
\p
\v 4 At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook, and the temple was filled with smoke.
\p
\v 5 Then I said:
\p Woe is me,
\p for I am ruined,
\p because I am a man of unclean lips
\p dwelling among a people of unclean lips ;
\p for my eyes have seen the King,
\p the LORD of Hosts.
\p
\v 6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar.
\v 7 And with it he touched my mouth and said:
\p Now that this has touched your lips,
\p your iniquity is removed
\p and your sin is atoned for.
\p
\v 8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying :
\p Whom shall I send?
\p Who will go for Us?
\p And I said:
\p Here am I. Send me!
\p
\v 9 And He replied:
\p Go and tell this people,
\p Be ever hearing , but never understanding;
\p be ever seeing , but never perceiving. \f + \fr 6:9 \fr* \ft Hebrew; LXX <i>‘You shall be ever hearing, but never understanding; you shall be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’</i> Cited in Matthew 13:14, Mark 4:12, Luke 8:10, and Acts 28:26\ft* \f*
\p
\v 10 Make the hearts of this people calloused;
\p deafen their ears and close their eyes.
\p Otherwise they might see with their eyes,

\p
\v 11 Then I asked:
\p How long , O Lord?
\p And He replied:
\p Until  the cities lie ruined

\p until the houses are left unoccupied

\v 12 until the LORD has driven men far away

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>A Message to Ahaz
\p
\v 1 Now in the days that Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, Rezin king of Aram \f + \fr 7:1 \fr* \ft That is, Syria\ft* \f* marched up to wage war against Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Pekah son of Remaliah the king of Israel, but he could not overpower the city.
\p
\v 2 When it was reported to the house of David that Aram was in league with Ephraim, \f + \fr 7:2 \fr* \ft Or <i>had set up camp in Ephraim</i>, that is, the northern kingdom of Israel\ft* \f* the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled like trees in the forest shaken by the wind.
\p
\v 3 Then the LORD said to Isaiah, Go out with your son Shear-jashub \f + \fr 7:3 \fr* \ft <i>Shear-jashub</i> means <i>a remnant shall return</i>.\ft* \f* to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct that feeds the upper pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field,
\v 4 and say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Do not be afraid or disheartened  over these two smoldering stubs of firewood— over the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah.
\v 5 For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted your ruin , saying:
\v 6 Let us invade Judah, terrorize it, and divide it \f + \fr 7:6 \fr* \ft Hebrew <i>split it open</i>\ft* \f* among ourselves. Then we can install the son of Tabeal over it as king.
\v 7 But this is what the Lord GOD says:
\p It will not arise;
\p it will not happen.
\p
\v 8 For the head of Aram is Damascus,
\p and the head of Damascus is Rezin.
\p Within sixty-five years
\p Ephraim will be shattered as a people.
\p
\v 9 The head of Ephraim is Samaria,
\p and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.
\p If you do not stand firm in your faith,
\p then you will not stand at all.

\r <br /><span class=|cross|>(<a href =|../matthew/1.htm#18|>Matthew 1:18–25</a>)</span>
\p
\v 10 Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, saying,
\v 11 Ask for a sign from the LORD your God, whether from the depths of Sheol or the heights of heaven.
\p
\v 12 But Ahaz replied, I will not ask; I will not test the LORD.

\v 1 For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob; once again He will choose Israel and settle them in their own land. The foreigner will join them and unite with the house of Jacob.
\v 2 The nations will escort Israel and bring it to its homeland.
\p Then the house of Israel will possess the nations as menservants and maidservants in the LORD’s land. They will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors.
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>The Fall of the King of Babylon
\p
\v 3 On the day that the LORD gives you rest from your pain and torment, and from the hard labor into which you were forced
\v 4 you will sing this song of contempt against the king of Babylon :
\p How the oppressor has ceased,
\p and how his fury \f + \fr 14:4 \fr* \ft DSS, LXX, and Syriac; MT <i>the golden city</i>\ft* \f* has ended!
\p
\v 5 The LORD has broken the staff of the wicked,
\p the scepter of the rulers.
\p
\v 6 It struck the peoples in anger
\p with unceasing blows;
\p it subdued the nations in rage
\p with relentless persecution.
\p
\v 7 All the earth is at peace and at rest;
\p they break out in song.
\p
\v 8 Even the cypresses \f + \fr 14:8 \fr* \ft Or <i>pines</i> or <i>junipers</i> or <i>firs</i>\ft* \f* and cedars of Lebanon
\p exult over you:
\p Since you have been laid low,

\p
\v 9 Sheol beneath is eager
\p to meet you upon your arrival.
\p It stirs the spirits of the dead to greet you—
\p all the rulers of the earth.
\p It makes all the kings of the nations
\p rise from their thrones.
\p
\v 10 They will all respond to you, saying,
\p You too have become weak, as we are;
\p you have become like us!
\p
\v 11 Your pomp has been brought down to Sheol,
\p along with the music of your harps.
\p Maggots are your bed
\p and worms your blanket.

\p I will ascend to the heavens;

\p above the stars of God.
\p I will sit on the mount of assembly,
\p in the far reaches of the north. \f + \fr 14:13 \fr* \ft Or <i>in the remote parts of Zaphon</i> or <i>on the heights of Zaphon</i>\ft* \f*

\p
\v 15 But you will be brought down to Sheol,
\p to the lowest depths of the Pit.
\p
\v 16 Those who see you will stare ;
\p they will ponder your fate:
\p Is this the man who shook the earth
\p and made the kingdoms tremble,
\p
\v 17 who turned the world into a desert
\p and destroyed its cities,
\p who refused to let the captives
\p return to their homes?

\v 18 All the kings of the nations lie in state,
\p each in his own tomb. \f + \fr 14:18 \fr* \ft Hebrew <i>house</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 19 But you are cast out of your grave like a rejected branch,

\p and dumped into a rocky pit
\p like a carcass trampled underfoot.
\p
\v 20 You will not join them in burial,
\p since you have destroyed your land
\p and slaughtered your own people.
\p The offspring of the wicked
\p will never again be mentioned.
\p
\v 21 Prepare a place to slaughter his sons
\p for the iniquities of their forefathers.
\p They will never rise up to possess a land
\p or cover the earth with their cities.
\p
\v 22 I will rise up against them,

\p I will cut off from Babylon
\p her name and her remnant,
\p her offspring and her posterity,
\p declares the LORD.
\p
\v 23 I will make her a place
\p for owls and for swamplands ;
\p I will sweep her away
\p with the broom of destruction,
\p declares the LORD of Hosts.
\s1 <p class=|hdg|>God’s Purpose against Assyria
\p
\v 24 The LORD of Hosts has sworn:
\p Surely , as I have planned, so will it be;
\p as I have purposed , so will it stand.
\p
\v 25 I will break Assyria in My land;
\p I will trample him on My mountain.
\p His yoke will be taken off My people,
\p and his burden removed from their shoulders.
\p
\v 26 This is the plan devised for the whole earth,
\p and this is the hand stretched out over all the nations.

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>Philistia Will Be Destroyed
\p
\v 28 In the year that King Ahaz died, this burden was received:

\p For a viper will spring from the root of the snake,

\p
\v 2 Dibon goes up to its temple
\p to weep at its high places.
\p Moab wails over Nebo,
\p as well as over Medeba.
\p Every head is shaved,
\p every beard is cut off.
\p
\v 3 In its streets they wear sackcloth;
\p on the rooftops and in the public squares
\p they all wail, falling down weeping.
\p
\v 4 Heshbon and Elealeh cry out;
\p their voices are heard as far as Jahaz.
\p Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out;
\p their souls tremble within.
\p
\v 5 My heart cries out over Moab;

\p as far as Eglath-shelishiyah . \f + \fr 15:5 \fr* \ft Or <i>Zoar, like a heifer three years of age.</i>\ft* \f*
\p With weeping they ascend the slope of Luhith;

\p
\v 6 The waters of Nimrim are dried up,
\p and the grass is withered;
\p the vegetation is gone,
\p and the greenery is no more.
\p
\v 7 So they carry their wealth and belongings
\p over the Brook of the Willows. \f + \fr 15:7 \fr* \ft Or <i>Poplars</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 8 For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab.

\p Hide the refugees;

\p his overflowing arrogance.
\p But his boasting is empty .
\p
\v 7 Therefore let Moab wail;
\p let them wail together for Moab.
\p Moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth,
\p you who are utterly stricken.
\p
\v 8 For the fields of Heshbon have withered,
\p along with the grapevines of Sibmah.
\p The rulers of the nations
\p have trampled its choicest vines,
\p which had reached as far as Jazer
\p and spread toward the desert.

\p with my tears.
\p Triumphant shouts have fallen silent
\p over your summer fruit and your harvest.
\p
\v 10 Joy and gladness are removed from the orchard;
\p no one sings or shouts in the vineyards.
\p No one tramples the grapes in the winepresses;
\p I have put an end to the cheering.

\p
\v 2 So I will incite Egyptian against Egyptian;
\p brother will fight against brother, neighbor against neighbor,

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>A Message for Shebna
\p
\v 15 This is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: Go, say to Shebna, the steward  in charge of the palace:
\v 16 What are you doing here, and who authorized you to carve out a tomb for yourself here — to chisel your tomb in the height and cut your resting place in the rock?
\p
\v 17 Look, O mighty man! The LORD is about to shake you violently . He will take hold of you,
\v 18 roll you  into a ball, and sling you into a wide land. There you will die, and there your glorious chariots will remain— a disgrace to the house of your master.
\v 19 I will remove you from office, and you will be ousted from your position.
\p
\v 20 On that day I will summon My servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
\v 21 I will clothe him with your robe and tie your sash around him. I will put your authority in his hand, and he will be a father to the dwellers of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
\v 22 I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open. \f + \fr 22:22 \fr* \ft See Revelation 3:7.\ft* \f*
\v 23 I will drive him like a peg into a firm place, and he will be a throne of glory for the house of his father.
\p
\v 24 So they will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house: the descendants and the offshoots— all the lesser vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar.
\p
\v 25 In that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, the peg driven into a firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and fall, and the load upon it will be cut down.
\p Indeed, the LORD has spoken.

\p Wail, O ships of Tarshish, \f + \fr 23:1 \fr* \ft Or <i>Wail, O fleet of trading ships</i>; also in verse 14\ft* \f*
\p for Tyre is laid waste,

\p whose traders have crossed the sea. \f + \fr 23:2 \fr* \ft DSS and LXX; MT <i>whom the seafarers have enriched</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 3 On the great waters
\p came the grain of Shihor;
\p the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre;
\p she was the merchant of the nations.
\p
\v 4 Be ashamed, O Sidon, the stronghold of the sea,
\p for the sea has spoken:
\p I have not been in labor
\p or given birth .
\p I have not raised young men
\p or brought up young women.
\p
\v 5 When the report reaches Egypt,
\p they will writhe in agony over the news of Tyre.
\p
\v 6 Cross over to Tarshish;
\p wail, O inhabitants of the coastland!
\p
\v 7 Is this your jubilant city,
\p whose origin is from antiquity ,
\p whose feet have taken her
\p to settle far away?
\p
\v 8 Who planned this against Tyre,
\p the bestower of crowns,
\p whose traders are princes,
\p whose merchants are renowned on the earth?
\p
\v 9 The LORD of Hosts planned it,
\p to defile all its glorious beauty,
\p to disgrace all the renowned of the earth.
\p
\v 10 Cultivate \f + \fr 23:10 \fr* \ft DSS and some LXX manuscripts; MT <i>Overflow</i>\ft* \f* your land like the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish;
\p there is no longer a harbor.
\p
\v 11 The LORD has stretched out His hand over the sea;
\p He has made kingdoms tremble.
\p He has given a command
\p that the strongholds of Canaan be destroyed.
\p
\v 12 He said, You shall rejoice no more ,
\p O oppressed Virgin Daughter of Sidon.
\p Get up and cross over to Cyprus—

\p
\v 13 Look at the land of the Chaldeans \f + \fr 23:13 \fr* \ft That is, the Babylonians\ft* \f*

\p The Assyrians destined it for the desert creatures;
\p they set up their siege towers and stripped its palaces.
\p They brought it to ruin.
\p
\v 14 Wail, O ships of Tarshish,
\p for your harbor has been destroyed!
\p
\v 15 At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years— the span of a king’s life. But at the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:
\p
\v 16 Take up your harp,
\p stroll through the city,
\p O forgotten harlot.
\p Make sweet melody,
\p sing many a song,
\p so you will be remembered.
\p
\v 17 And at the end of seventy years, the LORD will restore Tyre. Then she will return to hire as a prostitute and sell herself to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.
\v 18 Yet her profits and wages will be set apart to the LORD; they will not be stored or saved, for her profit will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothing.

\p
\v 6 Therefore a curse has consumed the earth,

\p
\v 7 The new wine dries up, the vine withers.
\p All the merrymakers now groan.
\p
\v 8 The joyful tambourines have ceased;
\p the noise of revelers has stopped;
\p the joyful harp is silent.
\p
\v 9 They no longer sing and drink wine;
\p strong drink is bitter to those who consume it.
\p
\v 10 The city of chaos is shattered;
\p every house is closed to entry.

\v 11 In the streets they cry out for wine.
\p All joy turns to gloom;
\p rejoicing is exiled from the land.
\p
\v 12 The city is left in ruins;
\p its gate is reduced to rubble.
\p
\v 13 So will it be on the earth

\p Glory to the Righteous One.
\p But I said, I am wasting away I am wasting away
\p Woe is me.

\p
\v 17 Terror and pit and snare await you,
\p O dweller of the earth.
\p
\v 18 Whoever flees the sound of panic
\p will fall into the pit,
\p and whoever climbs from the pit
\p will be caught in the snare.
\p For the windows of heaven are open,
\p and the foundations of the earth are shaken.
\p
\v 19 The earth is utterly broken apart ,
\p the earth is split open ,
\p the earth is shaken violently .
\p
\v 20 The earth staggers like a drunkard
\p and sways like a shack.
\p Earth’s rebellion weighs it down,

\p
\v 21 In that day the LORD will punish

\p
\v 22 They will be gathered together
\p like prisoners in a pit.
\p They will be confined to a dungeon

\v 14 This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he cannot deliver you.
\v 15 Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the LORD when he says, The LORD will surely deliver us ; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\p
\v 16 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me \f + \fr 36:16 \fr* \ft Or <i>Make a blessing with me</i>\ft* \f* and come out to me. Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree, and drink water from his own cistern,
\v 17 until I come and take you away to a land like your own— a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
\p
\v 18 Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, The LORD will deliver us. Has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
\v 19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?
\v 20 Who among all the gods of these lands has delivered his land from my hand? How then can the LORD deliver Jerusalem from my hand?
\p
\v 21 But the people remained silent and did not answer a word,  for Hezekiah had commanded Do not answer him.
\p
\v 22 Then Hilkiah’s son Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and Asaph’s son Joah the recorder came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and they relayed to him the words of the Rabshakeh.

\p
\v 1 On hearing this report, King Hezekiah tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and entered the house of the LORD.
\v 2 And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the scribe, and the leading priests, all wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz
\v 3 to tell him, This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace; for children have come to the point of birth, but there is no strength to deliver them.
\v 4 Perhaps the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to defy the living God, and He will rebuke him for the words that the LORD your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that still survives.
\p
\v 5 So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah,

\p Do not let your God, in whom you trust deceive you by saying that Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
\v 11 Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries, devoting them to destruction. \f + \fr 37:11 \fr* \ft Forms of the Hebrew <i>cherem</i> refer to the giving over of things or persons, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.\ft* \f* Will you then be spared?

\p
\v 21 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Because you have prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
\v 22 this is the word that the LORD has spoken against him:
\p The Virgin Daughter of Zion
\p despises you and mocks you;
\p the Daughter of Jerusalem
\p shakes her head behind you.

\v 23 Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?
\p Against whom have you raised your voice

\v 24 Through your servants you have taunted the Lord,

\p I have ascended

\p to the remote peaks of Lebanon.
\p I have cut down its tallest cedars,
\p the finest of its cypresses. \f + \fr 37:24 \fr* \ft Or <i>pines</i> or <i>junipers</i> or <i>firs</i>\ft* \f*

\v 26 Have you not heard?
\p Long ago I ordained it;
\p in days of old I planned it.
\p Now I have brought it to pass ,
\p that you should crush fortified cities
\p into piles of rubble.
\p
\v 27 Therefore their inhabitants, devoid of power,
\p are dismayed and ashamed.
\p They are like plants in the field,
\p tender green shoots,
\p grass on the rooftops,

\p
\v 28 But I know your sitting down,

\p
\v 29 Because your rage and arrogance against Me
\p have reached My ears,
\p I will put My hook in your nose
\p and My bit in your mouth;
\p I will send you back
\p the way you came.
\p
\v 30 And this will be a sign to you, O Hezekiah:
\p This year you will eat
\p what grows on its own,
\p and in the second year
\p what springs from the same.
\p But in the third year you will sow and reap;
\p you will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
\p
\v 31 And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah

\p
\v 32 For a remnant will go forth from Jerusalem,
\p and survivors from Mount Zion.
\p The zeal of the LORD of Hosts
\p will accomplish this.
\p
\v 33 So this is what the LORD says about the king of Assyria:
\p He will not enter this city
\p or shoot an arrow into it.
\p He will not come before it with a shield
\p or build up a siege ramp against it.
\p
\v 34 He will go back the way he came

\p
\v 12 My dwelling has been picked up and removed from me

\p O Daughter of the Chaldeans! \f + \fr 47:1 \fr* \ft That is, the Babylonians; also in verse 5\ft* \f*
\p For you will no longer be called
\p tender or delicate.
\p
\v 2 Take millstones and grind flour;
\p remove your veil;
\p strip off your skirt, bare your thigh,
\p and wade through the streams.
\p
\v 3 Your nakedness will be uncovered
\p and your shame will be exposed.
\p I will take vengeance;
\p I will spare no one.
\p
\v 4 Our Redeemer — the LORD of Hosts is His name —
\p is the Holy One of Israel.
\p
\v 5 Sit in silence and go into darkness,
\p O Daughter of the Chaldeans.
\p For you will no longer be called
\p the queen of kingdoms.
\p
\v 6 I was angry with My people;
\p I profaned My heritage,
\p and I placed them under your control.
\p You showed them no mercy;
\p even on the elderly you laid a most heavy yoke .
\p
\v 7 You said, I will be queen forever
\p You did not take these things to heart
\p or consider their outcome.
\p
\v 8 So now hear this,
\p O lover of luxury who sits securely ,
\p who says to herself,
\p I am, and there is none besides me.
\p I will never be a widow
\p or know the loss of children.
\p
\v 9 These two things will overtake you in a moment,
\p in a single day:
\p loss of children, and widowhood.
\p They will come upon you in full measure,
\p in spite of your many sorceries
\p and the potency of your spells .
\p
\v 10 You were secure in your wickedness;
\p you said, No one sees me.
\p Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray;
\p you told yourself, I am, and there is none besides me.
\p
\v 11 But disaster will come upon you;
\p you will not know how to charm it away.
\p A calamity will befall you
\p that you will be unable to ward off.
\p Devastation will happen to you
\p suddenly and unexpectedly .
\p
\v 12 So take your stand with your spells
\p and with your many sorceries,
\p with which you have wearied yourself
\p from your youth.
\p Perhaps you will succeed;
\p perhaps you will inspire terror!
\p
\v 13 You are wearied by your many counselors;
\p let them come forward now and save you—
\p your astrologers who observe the stars,
\p who monthly predict your fate .
\p
\v 14 Surely they are like stubble;
\p the fire will burn them up.
\p They cannot deliver themselves
\p from the power of the flame.
\p There will be no coals to warm them
\p or fire to sit beside.
\p
\v 15 This is what they are to you —
\p those with whom you have labored and traded from youth—
\p each one strays in his own direction;
\p not one of them can save you.

\p for the sake of My praise I will restrain it
\p so that you will not be cut off.

\v 10 See, I have refined you, but not as silver;
\p I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.

\v 3 He said to Me, You are My Servant, Israel,

\p
\v 4 But I said, I have labored in vain,

\p to bring Jacob back to Him,
\p that Israel might be gathered to Him—
\p for I am honored in the sight of the LORD,

\p
\v 1 Surely the arm of the LORD is not too short to save,

\p
\v 2 But your iniquities have built barriers
\p between you and your God,
\p and your sins have hidden His face from you,
\p so that He does not hear.
\p
\v 3 For your hands are stained with blood,
\p and your fingers with iniquity;
\p your lips have spoken lies,
\p and your tongue mutters injustice.
\p
\v 4 No one calls for justice;
\p no one pleads his case honestly.
\p They rely on empty pleas; they tell lies;
\p they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity.
\p
\v 5 They hatch the eggs of vipers
\p and weave a spider’s web.
\p Whoever eats their eggs will die;
\p crack one open, and a viper is hatched.
\p
\v 6 Their cobwebs cannot be made into clothing,

\p Their deeds are sinful deeds,

\v 7 Their feet run to evil;

\p They have turned them into crooked paths;
\p no one who treads on them will know peace.
\p
\v 9 Therefore justice is far from us,
\p and righteousness does not reach us.
\p We hope for light, but there is darkness;
\p for brightness, but we walk in gloom.
\p
\v 10 Like the blind, we feel our way along the wall,

\p We stumble at midday as in the twilight;
\p among the vigorous we are like the dead.

\p We hope for justice, but find none,
\p for salvation, but it is far from us.

\v 12 For our transgressions are multiplied before You,
\p and our sins testify against us.
\p Our transgressions are indeed with us,
\p and we know our iniquities:
\p
\v 13 rebelling and denying the LORD,
\p turning away from our God,
\p speaking oppression and revolt,
\p conceiving and uttering lies from the heart.
\p
\v 14 So justice is turned away ,
\p and righteousness stands at a distance.

\p
\v 3 to console the mourners in Zion —
\p to give them a crown of beauty for ashes,
\p the oil of joy for mourning,
\p and a garment of praise for a spirit of despair.
\p So they will be called oaks of righteousness,
\p the planting of the LORD, that He may be glorified.
\p
\v 4 They will rebuild the ancient ruins;
\p they will restore the places long devastated;
\p they will renew the ruined cities,

\v 5 Strangers will stand and feed your flocks,
\p and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers.
\p
\v 6 But you will be called the priests of the LORD;
\p they will speak of you as ministers of our God;
\p you will feed on the wealth of nations,
\p and you will boast in their riches.
\p
\v 7 Instead of shame, My people will have a double portion,
\p and instead of humiliation, they will rejoice in their share;
\p and so they will inherit a double portion in their land,
\p and everlasting joy will be theirs.

\v 8 For I, the LORD, love justice;
\p I hate robbery and iniquity;
\p in My faithfulness I will give them their recompense
\p and make an everlasting covenant with them.

\v 9 Their descendants will be known among the nations,
\p and their offspring among the peoples.
\p All who see them will acknowledge

\p
\v 10 I will rejoice greatly in the LORD,
\p my soul will exult in my God;
\p for He has clothed me with garments of salvation
\p and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness,
