\p
\v 1 Blessed is the man
\p who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
\p or set foot on the path of sinners,
\p or sit in the seat of mockers.
\p
\v 2 But his delight is in the Law of the LORD,
\p and on His law he meditates day and night.
\p
\v 3 He is like a tree planted by streams of water,
\p yielding its fruit in season,
\p whose leaf does not wither,
\p and who prospers in all he does.
\p
\v 4 Not so the wicked!
\p For they are like chaff driven off by the wind.
\p
\v 5 Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
\p nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
\p
\v 6 For the LORD guards the path of the righteous,
\p but the way of the wicked will perish.

\p
\v 1 Why do the nations rage \f + \fr 2:1 \fr* \ft Or <i>noisily assemble</i>; see Revelation 11:18.\ft* \f*
\p and the peoples plot in vain?
\p
\v 2 The kings of the earth take their stand
\p and the rulers gather together,

\p and against His Anointed One: \f + \fr 2:2 \fr* \ft Cited in Acts 4:25–26\ft* \f*
\p
\v 3 Let us break Their chains
\p and cast away Their cords.
\p
\v 4 The One enthroned in heaven laughs;
\p the Lord taunts them .
\p
\v 5 Then He rebukes them in His anger,
\p and terrifies them in His fury:
\p
\v 6 I have installed My King on Zion,
\p upon My holy mountain.
\p
\v 7 I will proclaim the decree
\p spoken to Me by the LORD:
\p You are My Son;
\p today I have become Your Father. \f + \fr 2:7 \fr* \ft Literally <i>today I have begotten You</i>; cited in Acts 13:33, Hebrews 1:5, and Hebrews 5:5\ft* \f*

\p
\v 9 You will break them \f + \fr 2:9 \fr* \ft LXX <i>You will rule them</i> or <i>You will shepherd them</i>\ft* \f* with an iron scepter;
\p You will shatter them like pottery . \f + \fr 2:9 \fr* \ft Cited in Revelation 2:27; see also Revelation 12:5 and Revelation 19:15.\ft* \f*
\p
\v 10 Therefore be wise, O kings;

\p
\v 11 Serve the LORD with fear,
\p and rejoice with trembling.
\p
\v 12 Kiss the Son, lest He be angry
\p and you perish in your rebellion,

\p Selah
\p
\v 5 I lie down and sleep;
\p I wake again, for the LORD sustains me.
\p
\v 6 I will not fear the myriads
\p set against me on every side.
\p
\v 7 Arise, O LORD!
\p Save me, O my God!
\p Strike all my enemies on the jaw;
\p break the teeth of the wicked.

\p
\v 3 In the morning, O LORD, You hear my voice;

\p and wait in expectation.
\p
\v 4 For You are not a God who delights in wickedness;

\v 5 The boastful cannot stand in Your presence;

\p
\v 6 You destroy those who tell lies;

\p
\v 7 But I will enter Your house
\p by the abundance of Your loving devotion; \f + \fr 5:7 \fr* \ft Forms of the Hebrew <i>chesed</i> are translated here and in most cases throughout the Scriptures as <i>loving devotion</i>; the range of meaning includes <i>love</i>, <i>goodness</i>, <i>kindness</i>, <i>faithfulness</i>, and <i>mercy</i>, as well as <i>loyalty to a covenant</i>.\ft* \f*
\p in reverence I will bow down
\p toward Your holy temple.
\p
\v 8 Lead me, O LORD, in Your righteousness
\p because of my enemies;
\p make straight Your way before me.
\p
\v 9 For not a word they speak can be trusted;
\p destruction lies within them.
\p Their throats are open graves;
\p their tongues practice deceit. \f + \fr 5:9 \fr* \ft Or <i>flattery</i>; cited in Romans 3:13\ft* \f*
\p

\p
\v 1 For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments, according to Sheminith. \f + \fr 6:1 \fr* \ft <i>Sheminith</i> is probably a musical term; here and in 1 Chronicles 15:21 and Psalm 12:1.\ft* \f* A Psalm of David.
\p O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger
\p or discipline me in Your wrath.
\p
\v 2 Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am frail;
\p heal me, O LORD, for my bones are in agony.
\p
\v 3 My soul is deeply distressed .
\p How long, O LORD, how long?
\p
\v 4 Turn, O LORD, and deliver my soul;
\p save me because of Your loving devotion.
\p
\v 5 For there is no mention of You in death;
\p who can praise You from Sheol?
\p
\v 6 I am weary from groaning;
\p all night I flood my bed with weeping
\p and drench my couch with tears.
\p
\v 7 My eyes fail from grief;
\p they grow dim because of all my foes.
\p
\v 8 Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,
\p for the LORD has heard my weeping.
\p
\v 9 The LORD has heard my cry for mercy;
\p the LORD accepts my prayer.
\p

\s1 <p class=|hdg|>I Take Refuge in You
\p
\v 1 A Shiggaion \f + \fr 7:1 \fr* \ft <i>Shiggaion</i> is probably a musical or liturgical term.\ft* \f* of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush, a Benjamite.
\p O LORD my God, I take refuge in You;
\p save me and deliver me from all my pursuers,

\p
\v 3 O LORD my God, if I have done this,
\p if injustice is on my hands,
\p
\v 4 if I have rewarded my ally \f + \fr 7:4 \fr* \ft Hebrew <i>the one at peace with me</i>\ft* \f* with evil,
\p if I have plundered my foe without cause,
\p
\v 5 then may my enemy pursue me and overtake me;
\p may he trample me to the ground
\p and leave my honor in the dust.
\p Selah
\p
\v 6 Arise, O LORD, in Your anger;
\p rise up against the fury of my enemies.
\p Awake, my God, and ordain judgment.
\p
\v 7 Let the assembled peoples gather around You;
\p take Your seat over them on high.
\p
\v 8 The LORD judges the peoples;
\p vindicate me, O LORD,
\p according to my righteousness and integrity .
\p
\v 9 Put an end to the evil of the wicked,
\p but establish the righteous,
\p O righteous God who searches hearts and minds. \f + \fr 7:9 \fr* \ft Hebrew <i>hearts and kidneys</i>\ft* \f*
\p
\v 10 My shield is with God,
\p who saves the upright in heart.
\p
\v 11 God is a righteous judge
\p and a God who feels indignation each day.
\p
\v 12 If one does not repent,
\p God will sharpen His sword;
\p He has bent and strung His bow.
\p
\v 13 He has prepared His deadly weapons;
\p He ordains His arrows with fire.
\p
\v 14 Behold, the wicked man travails with evil;
\p he conceives trouble and births falsehood.
\p
\v 15 He has dug a hole and hollowed it out;
\p he has fallen into a pit of his own making.
\p
\v 16 His trouble recoils on himself,
\p and his violence falls on his own head.
\p
\v 17 I will thank the LORD for His righteousness
\p and sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.

\p
\v 4 what is man that You are mindful of him,
\p or the son of man that You care for him?
\p
\v 5 You made him a little lower than the angels; \f + \fr 8:5 \fr* \ft Or <i>than God</i> or <i>than the heavenly beings</i>; see also LXX.\ft* \f*

\p
\v 7 all sheep and oxen,
\p and even the beasts of the field,

\p
\v 2 I will be glad and rejoice in You;
\p I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.
\p
\v 3 When my enemies retreat ,
\p they stumble and perish before You.
\p
\v 4 For You have upheld my just cause;
\p You sit on Your throne judging righteously.
\p
\v 5 You have rebuked the nations;
\p You have destroyed the wicked;
\p You have erased their name forever and ever.
\p
\v 6 The enemy has come to eternal ruin,
\p and You have uprooted their cities;
\p the very memory of them has vanished.
\p
\v 7 But the LORD abides forever;
\p He has established His throne for judgment.
\p
\v 8 He judges the world with justice;
\p He governs the people with equity.
\p
\v 9 The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed,
\p a stronghold in times of trouble.
\p
\v 10 Those who know Your name trust in You,
\p for You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.
\p
\v 11 Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion;
\p proclaim His deeds among the nations.

\p Lift me up from the gates of death,
\p
\v 14 that I may declare all Your praises —
\p that within the gates of Daughter Zion
\p I may rejoice in Your salvation.
\p
\v 15 The nations have fallen into a pit of their making;
\p their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
\p
\v 16 The LORD is known by the justice He brings;
\p the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands.
\p Higgaion Selah \f + \fr 9:16 \fr* \ft <i>Higgaion Selah</i> or <i>quiet interlude</i> is probably a musical or liturgical term.\ft* \f*
\p
\v 17 The wicked will return to Sheol—
\p all the nations who forget God.
\p
\v 18 For the needy will not always be forgotten;
\p nor the hope of the oppressed forever dashed.
\p
\v 19 Rise up, O LORD, do not let man prevail;

\v 1 Why, O LORD, do You stand far off?
\p Why do You hide in times of trouble?
\p
\v 2 In pride the wicked pursue the needy;
\p let them be caught in the schemes they devise.
\p
\v 3 For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart;
\p he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.
\p
\v 4 In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him;
\p in all his schemes there is no God.
\p
\v 5 He is secure in his ways at all times ;
\p Your lofty judgments are far from him;

\v 8 He lies in wait near the villages;
\p in ambush he slays the innocent;
\p his eyes watch in stealth for the helpless.
\p
\v 9 He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket;
\p he lurks to seize the oppressed;
\p he catches the lowly in his net .
\p
\v 10 They are crushed and beaten down; \f + \fr 10:10 \fr* \ft Or <i>He crouches and lies low</i>\ft* \f*
\p the helpless fall prey to his strength.

\v 11 He says to himself, God has forgotten;
\p He hides His face and never sees.
\p
\v 12 Arise, O LORD! Lift up Your hand, O God!
\p Do not forget the helpless.
\p
\v 13 Why has the wicked man renounced God?
\p He says to himself, You will never call me to account.
\p
\v 14 But You have regarded trouble and grief;
\p You see to repay it by Your hand.
\p The victim entrusts himself to You;
\p You are the helper of the fatherless.
\p
\v 15 Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer;
\p call him to account for his wickedness
\p until none is left to be found.
\p
\v 16 The LORD is King forever and ever;
\p the nations perish from His land.
\p
\v 17 You have heard, O LORD, the desire of the humble;

\p
\v 4 The LORD is in His holy temple;
\p the LORD is on His heavenly throne.
\p His eyes are watching closely;

\p
\v 5 The LORD tests the righteous and the wicked;

\v 1 For the choirmaster. Of David the servant of the LORD, who sang  this song to the LORD on the day the LORD had delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He said:
\p I love You, O LORD, my strength.
\p
\v 2 The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer.
\p My God is my rock, in whom I take refuge
\p my shield, and the horn of my salvation,

\p
\v 3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised;

\p
\v 4 The cords of death encompassed me;

\p
\v 5 The cords of Sheol entangled me;
\p the snares of death confronted me.
\p
\v 6 In my distress I called upon the LORD;
\p I cried to my God for help.
\p From His temple He heard my voice,
\p and my cry for His help reached His ears.
\p
\v 7 Then the earth shook and quaked,
\p and the foundations of the mountains trembled;
\p they were shaken because He burned with anger.
\p
\v 8 Smoke rose from His nostrils,
\p and consuming fire came from His mouth;
\p glowing coals blazed forth.
\p
\v 9 He parted the heavens and came down
\p with dark clouds beneath His feet.
\p
\v 10 He mounted a cherub and flew;
\p He soared on the wings of the wind.
\p
\v 11 He made darkness His hiding place,
\p and storm clouds a canopy around Him.
\p
\v 12 From the brightness of His presence
\p His clouds advanced —
\p hailstones and coals of fire. \f + \fr 18:12 \fr* \ft Or <i>bolts of lightning</i>; also in verse 13\ft* \f*

\p
\v 14 He shot His arrows and scattered the foes;

\p
\v 15 The channels of the sea appeared,
\p and the foundations of the world were exposed,
\p at Your rebuke, O LORD,
\p at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.
\p
\v 16 He reached down from on high and took hold of me;
\p He drew me out of deep waters.
\p
\v 17 He rescued me from my powerful enemy,
\p from foes too mighty for me.
\p
\v 18 They confronted me in my day of calamity,
\p but the LORD was my support
\p
\v 19 He brought me out into the open;
\p He rescued me because He delighted in me.
\p
\v 20 The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness;

\p
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD
\p and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\p
\v 22 For all His ordinances are before me;
\p I have not disregarded His statutes.
\p
\v 23 And I have been blameless before Him
\p and kept myself from iniquity.

\v 24 So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness,
\p according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.

\v 25 To the faithful You show Yourself faithful,

\p my God lights up my darkness.
\p
\v 29 For in You I can charge an army,
\p and with my God I can scale a wall.
\p
\v 30 As for God, His way is perfect;
\p the word of the LORD is flawless.
\p He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him.
\p
\v 31 For who is God besides the LORD?
\p And who is the Rock except our God?
\p
\v 32 It is God who arms me with strength
\p and makes my way clear.
\p
\v 33 He makes my feet like those of a deer
\p and stations me upon the heights.
\p
\v 34 He trains my hands for battle;
\p my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
\p

\p
\v 16 Better is the little of the righteous

\v 18 The LORD knows the days of the blameless,

\v 19 In the time of evil they will not be ashamed,

\p
\v 21 The wicked borrow and do not repay,
\p but the righteous are gracious and giving.
\p
\v 22 Surely those He blesses will inherit the land,
\p but the cursed will be destroyed.
\p

\p
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do good,

\p
\v 28 For the LORD loves justice
\p and will not forsake His saints.
\p They are preserved forever,

\p
\v 29 The righteous will inherit the land
\p and dwell in it forever.
\p
\v 30 The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom,
\p and his tongue speaks justice.
\p
\v 31 The law of his God is in his heart;
\p his steps do not falter.
\p
\v 32 Though the wicked lie in wait for the righteous,
\p and seek to slay them,
\p
\v 33 the LORD will not leave them in their power
\p or let them be condemned under judgment.
\p
\v 34 Wait for the LORD and keep His way,

\p When the wicked are cut off,
\p you will see it.
\p
\v 35 I have seen a wicked, ruthless man
\p flourishing like a well-rooted native tree,

\v 5 They are free of the burdens others carry;

\v 58 They enraged Him with their high places

\p
\v 65 Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,

\p
\v 66 He beat back His foes;
\p He put them to everlasting shame.
\p
\v 67 He rejected the tent of Joseph
\p and refused the tribe of Ephraim.
\p
\v 68 But He chose the tribe of Judah,
\p Mount Zion, which He loved.
\p
\v 69 He built His sanctuary like the heights,
\p like the earth He has established forever.
\p
\v 70 He chose David His servant
\p and took him from the sheepfolds ;

\v 71 from tending the ewes He brought him

\p You are God.

\p
\v 7 For we are consumed by Your anger

\p
\v 8 You have set our iniquities before You,

\v 9 For all our days decline in Your fury;

\p
\v 10 The length of our days is seventy years —

\v 11 Who knows the power of Your anger?
\p Your wrath matches the fear You are due.
\p
\v 12 So teach us to number our days,

\p Have compassion on Your servants.
\p
\v 14 Satisfy us in the morning with Your loving devotion,

\p
\v 1 Of David.
\p Bless the LORD, O my soul ;
\p all that is within me, bless His holy name.
\p
\v 2 Bless the LORD, O my soul,
\p and do not forget all His kind deeds —
\p
\v 3 He who forgives all your iniquities
\p and heals all your diseases,
\p
\v 4 who redeems your life from the Pit
\p and crowns you with loving devotion and compassion,
\p
\v 5 who satisfies you with good things,
\p so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
\p
\v 6 The LORD executes righteousness
\p and justice for all the oppressed.
\p
\v 7 He made known His ways to Moses,
\p His deeds to the people of Israel.
\p
\v 8 The LORD is compassionate and gracious,
\p slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion.
\p
\v 9 He will not always accuse us,
\p nor harbor His anger forever.
\p
\v 10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins
\p or repaid us according to our iniquities.
\p
\v 11 For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
\p so great is His loving devotion for those who fear Him.
\p
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west,
\p so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
\p
\v 13 As a father has compassion on his children,
\p so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.
\p
\v 14 For He knows our frame;
\p He is mindful that we are dust.
\p
\v 15 As for man, his days are like grass—
\p he blooms like a flower of the field ;
\p
\v 16 when the wind passes over, it vanishes,
\p and its place remembers it no more.
\p
\v 17 But from everlasting to everlasting
\p the loving devotion of the LORD
\p extends to those who fear Him,
\p and His righteousness to their children’s children —
\p
\v 18 to those who keep His covenant
\p and remember to obey His precepts.
\p
\v 19 The LORD has established His throne in heaven,
\p and His kingdom rules over all.
\p
\v 20 Bless the LORD, all His angels mighty in strength
\p who carry out His word,
\p who hearken to the voice of His command.
\p
\v 21 Bless the LORD, all His hosts,
\p you servants who do His will.

\p
\v 1 Bless the LORD, O my soul !
\p O LORD my God, You are very great;
\p You are clothed with splendor and majesty.
\p
\v 2 He wraps Himself in light as with a garment;
\p He stretches out the heavens like a tent,
\p
\v 3 laying the beams of His chambers
\p in the waters above,
\p making the clouds His chariot,
\p walking on the wings of the wind.
\p
\v 4 He makes the winds His messengers,
\p flames of fire His servants. \f + \fr 104:4 \fr* \ft LXX <i>He makes His angels winds, His servants flames of fire.</i> Cited in Hebrews 1:7\ft* \f*
\p
\v 5 He set the earth on its foundations,
\p never  to be moved.
\p
\v 6 You covered it with the deep like a garment;
\p the waters stood above the mountains.
\p
\v 7 At Your rebuke the waters fled;
\p at the sound of Your thunder they hurried away —
\p
\v 8 the mountains rose and the valleys sank
\p to the place You assigned for them —
\p
\v 9 You set a boundary they cannot cross,
\p that they may never again cover the earth.
\p
\v 10 He sends forth springs in the valleys;
\p they flow between the mountains.
\p
\v 11 They give drink to every beast of the field;
\p the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
\p
\v 12 The birds of the air nest beside the springs;
\p they sing among the branches.
\p
\v 13 He waters the mountains from His chambers;
\p the earth is satisfied by the fruit of His works.
\p
\v 14 He makes the grass grow for the livestock
\p and provides crops for man to cultivate,
\p bringing forth food from the earth:
\p
\v 15 wine that gladdens the heart of man,
\p oil that makes his face to shine,
\p and bread that sustains his heart.
\p
\v 16 The trees of the LORD have their fill,
\p the cedars of Lebanon that He planted,
\p
\v 17 where the birds build their nests;
\p the stork makes her home in the cypresses. \f + \fr 104:17 \fr* \ft Or <i>pines</i> or <i>junipers</i> or <i>firs</i>\ft* \f*

\p
\v 19 He made the moon to mark the seasons;
\p the sun knows when to set.
\p
\v 20 You bring darkness, and it becomes night
\p when all the beasts of the forest prowl.
\p
\v 21 The young lions roar for their prey
\p and seek their food from God.
\p
\v 22 The sun rises, and they withdraw;
\p they lie down in their dens.
\p
\v 23 Man goes forth to his work
\p and to his labor until evening.
\p
\v 24 How many are Your works, O LORD!
\p In wisdom You have made them all;
\p the earth is full of Your creatures.
\p
\v 25 Here is the sea, vast and wide ,
\p teeming with creatures beyond number ,
\p living things both great and small.
\p
\v 26 There the ships pass,
\p and Leviathan, which You formed to frolic there.
\p
\v 27 All creatures look to You
\p to give them their food in due season.
\p
\v 28 When You give it to them,
\p they gather it up;
\p when You open Your hand,
\p they are satisfied with good things.
\p
\v 29 When You hide Your face,
\p they are terrified;
\p when You take away their breath,
\p they die and return to dust.

\p
\v 31 May the glory of the LORD endure forever;
\p may the LORD rejoice in His works.
\p
\v 32 He looks on the earth,
\p and it trembles;
\p He touches the mountains,
\p and they smolder.
\p
\v 33 I will sing to the LORD all my life;
\p I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
\p
\v 34 May my meditation be pleasing to Him,

\p
\v 5 Remember the wonders He has done,

\p
\v 6 O offspring of His servant Abraham,
\p O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones.
\p
\v 7 He is the LORD our God;

\p
\v 8 He remembers His covenant forever,

\p
\v 9 the covenant He made with Abraham,
\p and the oath He swore to Isaac.
\p
\v 10 He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree,
\p to Israel as an everlasting covenant:
\p
\v 11 I will give you the land of Canaan

\p
\v 12 When they were few in number,

\p
\v 13 they wandered from nation to nation,
\p from one kingdom to another.
\p
\v 14 He let no man oppress them;
\p He rebuked kings on their behalf:
\p
\v 15 Do not touch My anointed ones!
\p Do no harm to My prophets!
\p
\v 16 He called down famine on the land
\p and cut off all their supplies \f + \fr 105:16 \fr* \ft Hebrew <i>staff</i>\ft* \f* of food.

\v 17 He sent a man before them—

\p
\v 18 They bruised his feet with shackles
\p and placed his neck in irons,
\p
\v 19 until his prediction came true
\p and the word of the LORD proved him right.
\p
\v 20 The king sent and released him;
\p the ruler of peoples set him free.
\p
\v 21 He made him master of his household,

\v 22 to instruct \f + \fr 105:22 \fr* \ft LXX and Syriac; MT <i>to bind</i>\ft* \f* his princes as he pleased

\p
\v 23 Then Israel entered Egypt;

\p
\v 24 And the LORD made His people very fruitful,
\p more numerous than their foes,
\p
\v 25 whose hearts He turned to hate His people,
\p to conspire against His servants.
\p
\v 26 He sent Moses His servant,
\p and Aaron, whom He had chosen
\p
\v 27 They performed His miraculous signs among them,

\p
\v 29 He turned their waters to blood
\p and caused their fish to die .
\p
\v 30 Their land teemed with frogs,

\p
\v 31 He spoke, and insects swarmed—
\p gnats throughout their country.
\p
\v 32 He gave them hail for rain,
\p with lightning throughout their land.
\p
\v 33 He struck their vines and fig trees
\p and shattered the trees of their country.
\p
\v 34 He spoke, and the locusts came—

\p
\v 35 They devoured every plant in their land
\p and consumed the produce of their soil.
\p
\v 36 Then He struck all the firstborn in their land,

\p
\v 37 He brought Israel out with silver and gold,

\v 38 Egypt was glad when they departed,

\p
\v 39 He spread a cloud as a covering
\p and a fire to light up the night.

\v 40 They asked, and He brought quail
\p and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
\p
\v 41 He opened a rock, and water gushed out;
\p it flowed like a river in the desert.
\p
\v 42 For He remembered His holy promise

\p
\v 43 He brought forth His people with rejoicing,

\p
\v 5 that I may see the prosperity of Your chosen ones,
\p and rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,
\p and give glory with Your inheritance.
\p
\v 6 We have sinned like our fathers;
\p we have done wrong and acted wickedly.
\p
\v 7 Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp Your wonders
\p or remember Your abundant kindness;
\p but they rebelled by the sea,
\p there at the Red Sea. \f + \fr 106:7 \fr* \ft Or <i>the Sea of Reeds</i>; also in verses 9 and 22\ft* \f*
\p
\v 8 Yet He saved them for the sake of His name,

\p
\v 9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up;
\p He led them through the depths as through a desert.
\p
\v 10 He saved them from the hand that hated them;
\p He redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
\p
\v 11 The waters covered their foes;
\p not one of them remained.
\p
\v 12 Then they believed His promises
\p and sang His praise.
\p
\v 13 Yet they soon forgot His works
\p and failed to wait for His counsel.
\p
\v 14 They craved intensely in the wilderness
\p and tested God in the desert.
\p
\v 15 So He granted their request,
\p but sent a wasting disease upon them.
\p
\v 16 In the camp they envied Moses,
\p as well as Aaron, the holy one of the LORD.
\p
\v 17 The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;
\p it covered the assembly of Abiram.
\p
\v 18 Then fire blazed through their company;
\p flames consumed the wicked.
\p
\v 19 At Horeb \f + \fr 106:19 \fr* \ft That is, Mount Sinai, or possibly a mountain in the range containing Mount Sinai\ft* \f* they made a calf
\p and worshiped a molten image.
\p
\v 20 They exchanged their Glory \f + \fr 106:20 \fr* \ft Or <i>their glorious God</i>\ft* \f*
\p for the image of a grass-eating ox.
\p
\v 21 They forgot God their Savior,
\p who did great things in Egypt,
\p
\v 22 wondrous works in the land of Ham,
\p and awesome deeds by the Red Sea.
\p
\v 23 So He said He would destroy them—
\p had not Moses His chosen one
\p stood before Him in the breach
\p to divert His wrath from destroying them.
\p
\v 24 They despised the pleasant land;
\p they did not believe His promise.
\p
\v 25 They grumbled in their tents
\p and did not listen to the voice of the LORD.
\p
\v 26 So He raised His hand and swore
\p to cast them down in the wilderness,
\p
\v 27 to disperse \f + \fr 106:27 \fr* \ft Or <i>cast down</i> or <i>cause to fall</i>\ft* \f* their offspring among the nations
\p and scatter them throughout the lands.
\p
\v 28 They yoked themselves to Baal of Peor
\p and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.
\p
\v 29 So they provoked the LORD to anger with their deeds,
\p and a plague broke out among them.
\p
\v 30 But Phinehas stood and intervened,
\p and the plague was restrained.
\p
\v 31 It was credited to him as righteousness
\p for endless generations to come.
\p
\v 32 At the waters of Meribah \f + \fr 106:32 \fr* \ft <i>Meribah</i> means <i>quarreling</i>; see Exodus 17:7.\ft* \f* they angered the LORD,
\p and trouble came to Moses because of them.
\p
\v 33 For they rebelled against His Spirit, \f + \fr 106:33 \fr* \ft Or <i>they provoked His Spirit</i>\ft* \f*
\p and Moses spoke rashly with his lips.
\p
\v 34 They did not destroy the peoples
\p as the LORD had commanded them,
\p
\v 35 but they mingled with the nations
\p and adopted their customs.
\p
\v 36 They worshiped their idols,
\p which became a snare to them.
\p
\v 37 They sacrificed their sons
\p and their daughters to demons.
\p
\v 38 They shed innocent blood—
\p the blood of their sons and daughters,
\p whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
\p and the land was polluted with blood.
\p
\v 39 They defiled themselves by their actions
\p and prostituted themselves by their deeds.
\p
\v 40 So the anger of the LORD burned against His people,
\p and He abhorred His own inheritance.
\p
\v 41 He delivered them into the hand of the nations,
\p and those who hated them ruled over them.
\p
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them
\p and subdued them under their hand.
\p
\v 43 Many times He rescued them,
\p but they were bent on rebellion
\p and sank down in their iniquity.
\p
\v 44 Nevertheless He heard their cry;
\p He took note of their distress .
\p
\v 45 And He remembered His covenant with them,
\p and relented by the abundance of His loving devotion.
\p
\v 46 He made them objects of compassion
\p to all who held them captive.
\p
\v 47 Save us, O LORD our God,
\p and gather us from the nations,
\p that we may give thanks to Your holy name,
\p that we may glory in Your praise.
